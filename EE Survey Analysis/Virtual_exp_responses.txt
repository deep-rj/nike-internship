Collaboration tools or boards

Highlight some of the best features so I can consider it more often as an alternative way to meet with my team
No complaints.
Video conferencing rooms are always challenging to use in connecting well with teammates in Asia. Always experience some form of technical difficulty.
Elevate Retail Field exposure to networking/virtual tools. I work in DTC and this could be a big help for us.
Better phones, TVs, conferencing systems in conference rooms.
It would be great to have more video conference rooms
The quality of the phone audio is usually very poor and makes it difficult to feel like you are understanding the conversations that are taking place.
Better audio and faster connection for Webex
Our team rarely uses virtual meetings. Most are conference calls, so not super familiar with the virtual meeting experience
Offer more training on using the various tools. They are painful to figure out as is.

Accessibility and standardization
Having a centralized location for virtual meeting instead of video conference then call in number and etc...
deploy campaign

WebEx at times does not open when working remotely
n/a
Most of our team is here on campus.  The need to use virtual meetings is not high.
Better technology to support the experience - for example, many conference rooms do not have the required hardware to connect to Surfaces.

n/A
Providing headsets
make it much more intuitive and better connections. often times the feeds are choppy and we rely on 1 person as our "expert" to help us troubleshoot.
Better understanding of the tools

Encourage people to use

n/a
Training
Making it easier to dial in and less of a hassle...especially if I need to jump on a call in between meetings while driving, typing all those numbers in becomes a hassle.
Increase number of smaller meeting rooms. With limited available conference rooms, it becomes even hard to just secure a room for yourself in order to attend a virtual meeting where discussion happens.
more training for those who are unfamiliar. it may be helpful to put how-to modules on NikeU. NABO Academy in NA Brand have creating great training to get people set up with WebEx etc and help troubleshoot. I think people shy away from these resources when they are unsure how easy they are to utilize. they are so efficient and helpful when working with other categories/functions across campus and other territories.
more VC rooms available
More conference rooms equipped with the technology
better training materials on tools that can be leveraged for virtual meetings.
We've never received instructions on how to do virtual meetings, can be hard to figure out on our own.
Would like to see a BlueJeans Mac Outlook add-on, similar to what's provided for Windows.
Automatic login rather than having to request access to the software. Team members typically don't ask how to access until the day before they have a meeting they need it for and that's too late to request/get access.
The technology used could be better in terms of speed, usability, troubleshooting, etc.
Make the process of easier of getting a WebEx account and adding it to Outlook. The resources on Zero were outdated.
Consolidate a list of tools that each department could use. In Nike Digital, we primarily use Slack as our communication channel while other departments on Nike use Cisco Jabber.
WebEx is still sometimes clunky; more streamlined setup.  Also making video conferencing easier would be helpful for geo collaboration/relationship building.

Big(ger) TV's (or screens) in all conference rooms.

Readily accessible "How-To" guide.

Phones in conference rooms could be better. They do not pick up sound clearly at all. Also connections to computers don't work well. The new dongles for the new MacBookAirs will give everyone an epileptic seizure. It takes longer to get the connections to work correctly for the MacBookAir than the actual meeting itself.
Better training
Incorporate a Skype or Webex component into Outlook to assist in ease of scheduling.
Consolidate the disparate sources of information on how to use, where to sign up, and what our official policies are on use. Some are dated zero posts, some are on the Nike wiki, some are tribal/institutional sources - Look to confirm practices and re-evangelize usage patterns among all users.
"1.More options than just webex.  
2.Need virtual meetings that allow for collaboration, a virtual whiteboarding that often happens during in-person meetings.  
3.Better polycoms for large conf rooms and polycoms present in all conf rooms/focus rooms.  Large group meetings are virtually impossible to attend virtually due to the inability to hear participants in the room
4.more mobile friendly virtual meetings.  webex is not really practical on a cell"
Make it easier and more user friendly (like Google Hangouts)

One standard meeting protocol across nike - hard to adjust when constantly doing new things (webex, blue jeans, etc)
Easier Webex experience

better wifi, better screens/cameras in big rooms, make it easier to to connect to big screens
"Provide a share site which explains the different option, a how-to manual 
showing how to hook up, what should appear on the screen....., visual how-to showing the different cords, remotes...Every time I need to use a room no one seems to know how (even10yr veterans)"
Make it fool-proof, technologically (always working).  But also, our culture doesn't support well conference calls and video calls (preference to only meet in person, or when most participants are in person they don't make it easy for video or telephonic participants to engage).
I wouldn't know, because I don't use those tools. Unless phone conference calls count?

Training - I am a new Director @ Nike...I do not know where to start to get a virtual meeting going. What tools? Are there passwords or conference passwords i need to acquire? Etc...
Make it easy to create and launch meeting
Provide speaker phones in meeting rooms with better microphones.
N/A.  WebEx is reliable and a great productivity tool.


Make it more simple to use with obvious buttons.  Most of the major activities - join, share screen, switch presenter, etc. should be right there and obvious instead of having to click through multiple menus.
I know folks don't use WebEx because they are unfamiliar with it.
Make all of the spaces easier to use like the technology in Evergreen 1
I don't think there is anything wrong with it, I just think nothing beats in person communication.
Training!! Create an environment with senior leaders that it is OK to VC into a meeting. Create more space where VC is available for small meetings.
Ease of use - example: ability for WebEx to call conference rooms
There seem to be multiple platforms in play, it would be nice if we had one consistent virtual meeting service provider.
n/a
More availability to HDVC rooms
N/A
Provide better equipment to hold virtual meetings.



I think informing managers on the benefits of these meetings is a huge step towards this...  I for one woul dlove to be able to view a deck on my own screen, instead of squinting at the large one.
It is difficult to figure out how to get access to the tools and there are, more often than not, technical hiccups

n/a
From a technology standpoint, being able to quickly setup a meeting without creating an account with WebEx or a lengthly process to setup a virtual meeting would be helpful.


There seems to always be issues with logging into webex. Without fail, there are troubles with people being able to share their screen. So, we could maybe have best practices outlined. I'm not sure if it's what we can do or if webex should be better.
Easier setting up of virtual conferences / sharing of screens.
More accessible in our building.
at this time I am satisfied with it

"In the order of priority:

Integrate a softphone with Webex/conferncing tool, so that we could use one dialing solution irrespective of using PC, Phone or mobile to connect. 

Convert the desktop phone in the meeting rooms into a softphone where we can login to webex using our ID or a PIN and start a meeting. 

Provide a tool that has the capability to create transcripts of the conversation. Ability for multiple people to share desktops.

Availability of telepresence rooms if not in all buildings in vicinity of every building.

Ability for multiple people to collaborate on certain applications i.e. Office suite.

Ability for meeting rooms to be intelligent, to autocancel meetings if someone does not arrive on time. Allow people to flex meetings if they forecaast any delay in start and end and have this be communicated to the next person."
YES!  Virtual meetings are becoming a way of life with our distributed work force!  I personally hate to have a straight dial-in when participating remotely.  It is ineffective for both me and the participants in the room.  Having an effective, consistent,  and usable tool for enabling video and content sharing is critical to improving our effectiveness.  Webex certainly isn't it.  Slack has been helpful for those teams that use it.  Have had a positive experience so far participating in BlueJeans - though i haven't yet set up my own meetings using it.  Getting everyone using the same tool seems to be challenging.  Also, tool is only part of the battle.  If conference rooms are equipped to mesh with out goal of enabling effective remote collaboration, we haven't won the battle.
I believe WebEx is a great tool. In the past, I used it and participated in far more WebEx meetings based upon the spread of my team.  Today, my interaction with those I support don't typically require a WebEx format.  When needed I do use the WebEx format to initiate conference calls but rarely need the on-screen technology share.
WebEx often drops calls when it fails, causing confusion on long calls.
It would be great to have more video conferencing capabilities.
N/A
I don't know if this is an option already, but being able to join a video conference easily from your phone would be great (Android and iOS). The easier the better too. I think my team would probably enjoy something like that if it was as easy as pressing a button for them.
Easier access to video conferencing.  More user-friendly tools
Improve/upgrade the meeting room technology. Many times the technology works well, but the screens or cords are not working and it impacts our ability to conduct smooth meetings.
reduce lag time between USA and Asia.
Can't think of anything.  Only reason I prefer in person attendance for meetings is because it is much easier to read non-verbal communication and to know when it is appropriate to interject with commentary or questions than it is in a virtual meeting.
I guess by improving quality, outreach for using virtual meetings
WebEx gives good visibility on who is in attendance. I wish teleconference had the same tools.
Anything that can be done to make it easier to carry on with a webex meeting even if the webex owner hasn't joined would be helpful.  (if they don't join, we usually all disconnect and reconnect with a different webex name, but it's a hassle).
Explain in greater detail the directions for calling into conference calls.
tend to have difficulty presenting and then also having multiple people call in via video conference

go to a more common platform like Skype
Should be consistently available in all buildings & should have a helpdesk for this
Speed! It is challenging/impossible to share any video content via webex.
Wider adoption of video conferencing
more videoconferencing technology, and better communication regarding the available tools
I think the webX tool is great.  no issues what so ever!
Video conferencing would be better than webex and conference calls.  Then you can see the participants faces
N/A
N/A

Better communication on setting it up and using it with other geos. I have many team members who have been here for over a year who were never given instructions on how to setup webex.
no issues
Make it so that only one person can talk at a time so that people are not talking over one another.
Performance is frequently an issue.  Especially when using UC, Webex, or BlueJeans.

Standardize the process to one system.
Streamline sign-on to the system. WedEx sometimes seems to lag.
We need more bandwidth to handle video.  We need our security software, VPN, and network to support cloud engineering activities better.
Better connectivity. Often have significant lag and/or drop outs.
N/A
Improve Internet Speed Quality and tools for people that work in Asia (and not base on a NLO)
It's difficult to call into the Conf Call #s when driving, there are so many #s you have to enter.  I know there are Aps out there that let you store frequently used call in #s and passcodes, so that you can dial in with one-click.  Would be great to find something like this for Nike.
Faster network connection.

I THINK WE DON'T USE IT BECAUSE ORIGINAL MEETING INVITES WERE NOT SETUP WITH IT. IT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL TO USE IT WITH OVERSEAS CALLS

Having a good integrated tool for call in and Webex. Currently has too many issues.

provide training on how to best use the tools and how to navigate
Have clear visible instructions in each room on how to work videoconferencing - make sure they are all working - half the time they don't work.
"- Train the users, how to use tools like WebEx and other communication channels effectively.
- Create appropriate ground rules for teleconferences like No multi-tasking (e.g., running e-mail while participating in the telecom).
• Participants must identify themselves when they speak
• Use of “mute” technology as per group agreement"

Some rooms are equipped with Cisco video conferencing capabilities.  However, I have never seen anyone who has been able to use the equipment.
not used in our team  n/a
Making sure that all conference rooms have properly functioning equipment, ie, phones that work, cables and connectivity cords that are not damaged, functioning TVs, etc.
Get BlueJeans kinks out :-)  I have trouble syncing with a room system and getting audio to function correctly.  Also we need mandatory WebEx, BlueJeans training for all employees so everyone can utilize collaboration tools....more Video conference rooms would be a HUGE help...especially if they're larger (15 or more participants in the room).
Better tools, accessible online how-to documents, on-demand training, reliable and easy wireless conference room connectivity (check out Intel Unite), virtual meeting etiquette training
a single tool to fulfill everyone's needs
By making it as simple as possible to set up your own profile, the meeting and while using the tool.

Please enable all users to be able to use Bluejeans.
No idea.  Seems pretty straight forward.
Sometimes meeting invites are sent (by colleagues) with "Outlook safe link" URLs that cause problems on MacOS clients.  It would be awesome if the meeting invites could include links that are unmolested by Outlook.

I work in close proximity with most people I need to interact with. The main remote group I work with is our factory stores and they often have tech gaps, insufficient bandwidth, old computers
improve integrated audio. It's difficult to hear participants via WebEx and conference calls.
Stay with one tool.  Seems tools keep getting on-boarded as pilots and we change every year.
by improving voice quality over phone, reducing background noise, improving Video / screen sharing options

We utilize a plethora of forms of technology as it is a necessity within our work space and those around us.
The virtual meeting experience with a lot of tools never really seem to work. Whether it's the video or the audio, there's often some sort of problem. The best success we've has is with Slack or with simple FaceTime audio calls. However, you always need to be ready for troubleshooting time.
BY CONDUCTING VIDEO CONFERENCING
conference call
Sometimes there are glitches and lag time in video conferencing.  Also, half the time our AV stuff doesn't work.
Technology always seems to require trouble shooting
Webex is confusing, it would be easier if we were authorized to use google hangouts! Our team has started using slack calls, and those have worked really well.
not sure; I use it too rarely
Conference rooms with AV equipment that is not broken.
Still a little cumbersome and prone to failure. Too many clicks to get a meeting started and shared. Low voice quality.
A single consistent tool would be helpful.  Separate codes for dial in vs. calling on phone is confusing.
The audio on virtual meetings is never adequate. It can't compare to in-person, especially in larger rooms with more than a couple attendees. It's not only difficult to understand but it's challenging to determine who is speaking.
recently I can't record the sessions to play for other team members.


no improvement needed
I have infrequently needed to use a virtual meeting since joining nike. From past experience the important features I have valued: simple connectivity (dial in + web experience), simplicity in changing presenters, white boarding feature can be handy. Video feed is not very useful.

cords/cables/connections are sometimes not available in video conference rooms depending on the type of laptop/tablet being connected
Using virtual tools for meetings is currently very accessible and easy to use, however would require a culture shift for this to be more acceptable. If I am in the building or can travel for a meeting, it is better that I be there in person instead of attending via Webex or phone which sends the message of less engaged.
Educate employees of the benefits of WebEx, Teleconferencing, and other tools so that they understand the benefits (and cost savings)
N/A

video conf, virtual whiteboards
Faster connection to start the meeting (minimize the amount of dialing for phone #, conference #, attendee id#, etc)
Clear instructions for both host and participants.  Standard program across the company.

Our team requires screensharing functionality when we have meetings in order to show code we are developing. Currently, the only tool we are aware of at Nike with this functionality is Jabber. So many other meeting tools are not helpful without this ability.
By enabling quick settings to schedule and operate
Utilizing those tools more to become more familiar.
Unified video, audio capabilities.  Honestly, having to setup two different systems is beyond strange in this day and age.
Make it easier to understand.
Easier to navigate tools and more accessibility
Clearer instructions on how to get started and what you need in order to set up a meeting or host a meeting would be nice.
Not all rooms at WHQ are set up for successful meetings. It's hard to use the equipment and there are no instructions.

Easy to access and intuitive
The phone woman takes FOREVER to start your meeting.  The number of times she says "pound of hash symbol" costs this company a collective decade annually :).
Increase video quality, audio quality, and connection reliability.

intercall and voice support for phones and not use a laptop as mic and speaker. some rooms have this, other rooms have just a tv with hdmi
I think Slack is becoming the primary tool for most communication. Let's integrate with it if we can. I know they have integrations with a lot of virtual meeting tools, including screen sharing.
Better sound quality and ease of connection

by making it user friendly and dependable.
NA
Provide training on using the technology
It's ok, but people tend to check email and get in side conversations resulting in less collaboration. Nothing really you can do about this.
Generally, I think there should be more emphasis on virtual meetings. The time lot traveling to/from meetings is valuable and easy to get back by eliminating the face-to-face meetings. I also think there should be more of an emphasis on working from home to ease the load on the environment and increase productivity, especially for that that have a long commute.
Sometimes the audio isn't very good and when you are not a participant in the meeting and trying to listen it, the voices all blur together.
think it is fine as is
more information on how to use and set up

Improving the visual experience
I don't know. I don't use it often enough.
Meeting rooms are inconsistent with the ability to leverage screens, video conference, and screen sharing. Improving the technology and performance in meeting rooms would make virtual meetings more successful.
I think it is already a great tool to use.
better training
easier way for teams to access information/ numbers/ and conference space
I haven't used virtual meetings enough to know what to improve
I have personally not used the virtual meeting and can't speak to it

Seems great when I've used it, but rarely do

Make it easy for attendees esp. No "lobby" waiting room, integrated Conf # so attendees can dial in either way but host only needs to choose one, allow desktop sharing by all attendees, allow opening the meeting w\o the host (any attendee can launch). Train staff on tips & tricks of attending and presenting
Call in from the WebEx interface instead of having WebEx + Conf call line?
Better microphones / phone systems in conference rooms
na

Improve the hardware in conference room so it's not so difficult to connect laptops to monitors and have them stay connected throughout the meeting.
Have more video conferencing-enabled rooms, ability to broadcast whiteboard sessions, offer hands-free phone headsets as standard equipment, have a working Polycom in every conference room with sufficient microphone peripherals to cover the room (being able to hear everyone in the room is the biggest barrier to virtual meetings), ensure strong WIFI signals throughout NIKE buildings, make more meeting rooms available (not practical to hold meetings at your desk in an open/freestyle officescape - you must book a room).
More rooms with appropriate functionalities
I do not attend meetings that require this technology.  Training before deployment is a good practice when launching new technologies.
Training/education on what tools to use
Train team on meeting technology and collaboration methods
Provide everyone access to BlueJeans, then make users aware of its capability.

WebEx always seems to be flakey, at least in our building.
Bluejeans is a big step up from webex, so that is already an improvement. It just needs to be be more widely used.
It would be great if I could talk via my computer instead of having to use a cell phone or landline

Had problems setting up webex. most of the cases others couldn't hear my voice.
The meeting spaces we have set up for virtual meetings need to be maintained better and it needs to be easier to connect. The problem I'm running into more and more often is that the cables to connect my computer to a TV screen or project are worn out and I either can't get my screen to show up or it does show up but screen is a shade of blue, yellow, red or magenta that makes it hard to see.
No issues
Better/faster connection with non-USA.

Have more video conference rooms
don't sue it enough to know
Introducing a Whiteboard and face2face meeting experience

A more friendly tool. I've been here long enough to know how to use it HOWEVER to get the tool on your computer can...at times...take an act of god. I'd consider a more user friendly tool / virtual classroom that is pushed to your computer when you begin here. We are a global company and have 80+ buildings here at WHQ. We can't always get everywhere we need to be yet our company culture expects to see everyone in person. A different tool arrangement would really help.
Be able to see the room if there are multiple people in a room and some people calling in.
Settle on a single vendor.  Make sure it has just a plain simple dial-in option
Have a single virtual meeting tool everyone uses and incorporate it with sending Microsoft Outlook meeting invites
More training on how to use all of the technology (like the cisco cameras and phones) in the conference rooms
Give us better tools. WebEx is terrible. Support tools like Zoom.
One uniform tool. Each area of business seems to use multiple tools.
Meeting rooms need to have an easier interface. Current one often doesn't work. Even something as simple sharing your screen is a massive pain, sometimes.
The virtual meeting experience has been pretty good.  Webex has been a decent and efficient tool.
Make Slack Video call the standard 1:1 meeting assistant. Fill the conference video calls + shared whiteboard gap (Zoom is pretty awesome, realtimewhiteboard is another).
Common set of tools across all Nike to virtualize all the functions like screen sharing, white boarding, video and audio chat that can be used either from a desktop/laptop or connected to a conference room.
By improving the quality of audio (via phone, to complement webex visual, as we often have several people looking at one person's laptop and participating in the meeting via phone audio rather than one individual per laptop.


improve the phones/microphones in the conference rooms. for those of us calling into a meeting held in a Nike conference room, the conference phones don't pick up everything meeting attendees in the conference room are saying. it's really hard to hear and the mic cuts out especially when more than one person is talking. also culturally speaking, there's an expectation at Nike for people to be in attendance physically all the time which is impossible with our global footprint and 24/7 support expectations. poor technology experiences like the conference room phone/microphone issue I raised above reinforce this.
Use meeting tools that function entirely in a web browser.
I don't have much reason to use it as most meetings are within walking distance for me.
Better UI platform and experience, more training materials
one button connectivity!
I don't know we don't use them.
Higher quality video conferencing other than specific video con rooms.
The answer I needed wasn't an option...for my role VM's are not necessary. I set them up constantly for my team...either VC, or conf calls, have been in two meetings with Blue jeans originated from EU but not sure if its Nike approved or if we have a license...have not used Jabber for meetings...
Make sure that the equipment is easy to use, and works properly. Maybe have a laminated printable instructions in the room

Have WebEx accounts created for everyone and just provide them with instructions on how to access. Push WebEx vs. today employee has to Pull info on how to get access to it and how to use it
Reduce the amount of meeting rooms.
For me personally, have a dedicated deskphone headset would be beneficial. Our team doesn't do a lot of virtual meetings so that's why we don't have it, but I think every employee (or desk) should have a headset to make/attend call/attend meetings.

More video rooms
Simplicity of the applications and dependability of the virtual meeting connections.
Standardize the tool. Some use WebEx, some use other products.
one click setups, fix audio conferencing. it usually webex on the computer, telecon on the phone.

Actually think the experience is pretty good - problem is getting other people to use it who are scared of the technology
Don't know
more education and training for everyone to get on the same platform
Improved user interface/usability + increase access across devices
Our team uses Zoom which works well enough.
better sound, better image
Nothing. It works great. Just typically meet with people in person.
Provide employees with headsets/earphones that work with our laptops. We struggle to have privacy while working on WebEx meetings, and/or lose the ability to speak when we're in an open environment and need to use headphones that don't transmit sound both ways.
It would be awesome if there was a tutorial with information regarding how to use Smart Rooms (virtual conferencing rooms) with BlueJeans. Maybe this exists but I'm not aware of how to use the Smart Room capabilities.
Ease of connectivity.  It always takes some time to connect and dial the correct number.
I use the conference center setup on a rare occasion to meet with overseas partners on video, and there is no quick access guide readily available.
Better tools
Make the quality of sound better. It's most challenging when the connection is too tenuous for understanding.
TRAINING. And letting us know if we are supposed to use WebEx or BlueJeans or....??
Integrate with mobile
At times, the technology in the WHQ NW campus physical meeting room does not have the right connections to project on the conference in room screen.  My computer needs a USB adapter to project on the screen.
Better Audio setup to each person like headphone, etc. Laptop audio gives more echo.
Get my phone connected to my computer.  It's very 1990 to have a desk phone.  I have a desk phone, cell phone, and computer.  I should be able to have a iPad, iPhone and computer and that is it.
better equipped meeting rooms, displays, phones, more comfortable furniture, availability
Newer Cisco IP phones, and the implementation of smoother video conferencing would enhance the meeting experience, bringing video, and thus a more personal feeling to team/global meetings.
The more people who understand it - - the easier it is to offer it as an option.

have fewer of them

The Webex starting message is too long....
make it easier to signup for the tools

Need better audio and visual tool.  Sometimes when people are talking, it's not clear on the speaker phone, and when someone is drawing on a board, the person dial in cannot see what the person draw.
Once in a while during webex call, the audio remains stable while video is sometimes lost.
Current available tools work perfectly fine.

Ensure technology in conference rooms always works and is intuitive to use.
I would say WebEx is not a very user friendly, visually friendly, collaborative tool. Even if you simply look at the fact that call-in users have "images" that appear that take away from the participants seeing each other face to face (because you cannot simply see the cameras of all the participants, you are limited to roughly 6-8 at a time, necessitating scrolling).
Deploy usable teleconference rooms that use a standard format and that can be leveraged globally to reduce travel.

Even boarder internet bandwidth, higher visual resolution and more meeting rooms with HDVC capability

Better sound quality - often it can be difficult to hear participants.
Webex is not intuitive to use.      Since no one in my team uses it,  the time I had to setup Webex meeting wasted a lot of time trying to figure it out since had no one to ask
Virtual meetings work well with our group, however verbal communication can be hard especially if you have several people attending the meeting or if you have a mix of attendees in a conference room and on the phone.  There are not enough phones in the conference room to allow those on the phones to hear conversations.
With more developed software and infrastructure.
I dont use it much but i think the easier you can make a virtual meeting the better.
Having screens in rooms that work vs. being shades of blue, red, or green. Providing clear instructions on how to use and book tools for virtual meeting tools (cameras in conference rooms and tools you can use on your desk top).
training
Seminars on how to set up meetings virtually/ access to more information on how to  capitalize on virtual meetings
use it more

Seeing others is helpful and might help keep callers focused on meeting instead of something else.

Better connections
Maybe each one in the meeting could share the screen at the same time.
More small rooms to attend virtual meetings, improve VPN connection reliability, improve mobile device capabilities
I no longer use my work number because the Avaya application is awful. It would be nice to have our work numbers integrated with Jabber or deploy Lync so that we don't have to use our cell phone all the time. It would also be nice to get our voicemail transcribed into an email. I have not checked my voicemail in over a year and my mailbox is not full. I would like to just disable it or improve it.

By promoting the existing tools more so teams don't go outside to procure additional tools that are often redundant in functionality. These other tools are sometimes easier to use or offer better features, so enhancing the current offerings may be helpful.
Better bandwidth allocation I guess.
webex works great !
honestly I think it is a Nike cultural thing, people love to have face to face meetings. If webex is being used for someone remote a lot of the time it is hard to hear the people in the rooms because there are not enough microphones. I think it helps to use video so you can see the virtual people. I would love to do more remote meetings, because I spend way too much time traveling between campus and the evergreen buildings.
Right now there seems to be two different platforms of the same product, once consistent way to access would be better.


Better new employee onboarding/understanding of how to obtain and integrate Webex with Outlook.  It's very intuitive once you get it all set up.  However, getting Webex PLUS the Outlook Plug-In PLUS a conference line can be quite challenging.  Then, sometimes it stops working due to challenges with outlook.
Providing trainings on how to use virtual meetings and Jabber features. Use a campaign to promote the trainings in order to reach as many people as possible.
A virtual meeting company that provides a better user experience where the software actually shows who is talking. Much of the time you get "Call-in User_<some number>". If you are unfamiliar with their voice you don't know who is talking. It could also be training or uncommon setup between employee accounts. Settings are fairly limited on Webex.
Better infrastructure/wi-fi. Video conference meetings are stilted or jittery sometimes esp. when I cam on wi-fi.
Better technology in conference rooms

Make it so that setting up a live meeting is as easy and non time consuming as physically opening my laptop computer.
I think it is great!  It integrates with Jabber and Outlook which I use a lot.  No, changes are needed for me.
I think coaching or teaching on using the technology and on installing the programs required on your PC/Mac.
Not always easy to find a dongle, each person has a different computer and different inputs.
Better infrastructure in buildings to make it seamless.
Easy to start and quick to connect
Make signing up for WebEx easier, have a video tutorial on how to use it.
Making the resources more known. I have used a web-ex in the past, but I personally wouldn't know how to setup my own web-ex and send it out. The other resources you mentioned (blue jeans) I have never heard of.
Simple video conferencing available in conference rooms and from our laptops.
Better reliability with WiFi.
The WebEx add on in Outlook was constantly shutting down my Outlook.  It's now disabled and I have to re-enable and then disable it each time I want to send a WebEx meeting.  We also really need to improve the mic pick-ups and speakers on the conference call phones.  Folks who call in frequently have to ask in-person people to speak up.
BCC has a variety of computer/AV adapters in every conference room - would be great to get those in Oscillate!
1. Better poly-coms phones in the meeting rooms  2. The ability to whiteboard virtually, so that when a facilitator writes something on the whiteboard (or, theoretically, some kind of touchscreen that digitizes what's being drawn), it can be instantly shared/visible to those attending the meeting virtually.

Works fine for me.
Get more people on the tools including screen sharing whenever possible.
Equip users with the tools and training to understand the value and capability available to them. New tools are rolled out all the time and often devalued.
the rooms always seem to have something wrong. Either you can get audio, but no screen, or screen but no audio. It's rare these meetings go off without a hitch.
"The technology behind virtual meetings is a solid as it could be; the improvement we need is in space. Less crowded desk areas, cubicles, or greatly increasing the number of small flex spaces (the little rooms that only fit one or two people) so I can call (or web) in peace.

It's unrealistic to call into meetings from my desk (it's too noisy in my area plus I disrupt the people around me) so I have to find a conference room anyway, and at that point if it is at all possible it's better to go to the other humans, even if it means a 20 minute drive."
have more monitors in conference rooms and make Webex more accessible to teammates



Better audio quality and better presentation equipment/connections in offices
n/a
Bring it in line with Keep it Tight and utilize a secure platform other than WebEx
Using more interactive features would be great.
Every employee is automatically signed up to use the different services. One log in.

One Click set up and easier to share with others for pop up meeting

It would be nice if you could do a dual screen.  For example, we use virtual meetings to train our partners around the world and it would be really helpful if they could see what we are doing on our screen and do it on theirs at the same time, and see both windows on the same screen.
Sometimes the camera or sound does not work.
Make videoconferencing systems more intuitive across all Nike headquarter locations globally
Equip all buildings with the same technology.  Traveling between buildings and having different technologies requires me to learn the quirks of each tool.  Also, we too many chat tools (Jabber, SLACK, Yammer, etc.)
It's fine. I just don't need to meet virtually very often.
I really only know how to use webex meetings. I tried having a video conference in one of our meeting rooms but couldn't figure out how to initiate the call. So i would say making sure tools are very intuitive or having step by step directions in video conference rooms could help.
Bluejeans is superior to Webex. I'd recommend rolling this out to more people.


Better voice and video responses
Easier Setup/Training on virtual meeting tools available to use
Maybe dont require people to be on-site and virtual meetings will work itself out
I think it is more of an awareness that the tools are available, but also how to get your own account setup to use. When I first came to Nike no one could help me figure out how to get my own WebEx account set up. It took longer then it should have and I only got my own account after working on a project that was going to release the new version of it. I think NikeNow will help in this process, but when I talk to peers, people just don't know what they don't know.
Make easier to set up these meetings and improve call/video quality
wifi and connection issues.  many issues with IT cables
Quicker meeting initialization. Currently the host has multiple steps - open the calendar invite, click the Webex link, login, start the virtual meeting, call the conference telephone number, enter code, PIN & several prompts.
improve the network
EASIER TO USE, NOT INTUITIVE
Audio integration would make the process a bit more seamless. Typically the WebEx meetings require a separate phone # to dial into.
By making working from home a part of the company culture
Better microphones

The phones in the conference rooms have poor audio quality.
get everyone into the same room.
Slack is a great tool for virtual meeting. However, meetings in-person more productive.
Too many prompts - should be able to call in through digital phones connected on computer. Many people not aware of webex integration in outlook.

We have a lot of technology connectivity issues in our building - the screens change colors, the VM/HDMI ports are faulty, the plugs for the conference calls are constantly kicked out because they are bulky and under the center of the tables
"We have installed video conferencing which is helpful.

We have installed TVs and audio.  The TVs don't always work"
I think Webex is great - seems to work really well. Can't think of what i would change.
Allow us to manually go through the slides ourselves rather than mirroring another users computer.
"* Better quality audio conferencing speakers and mics.  Perhaps more mics in each conference room.
* Better video quality and consistent interfaces for conference room video equipment.  For instance, some rooms support Enzo and other do not.  
* It would be great if we had one meeting web site (other than WebEx) that was integrated with BOX for file sharing and Slack for team collaboration that allowed for teleconferencing & video conferencing, along with capabilities for ad-hoc screen sharing when IM'ing with someone ."
integrate teleconferences into the screens in the conference room more easily -- I have no idea how those things work, there are no instructions in the rooms and I've only seen them used once in my entire career at Nike

Let us work from home so we have the opportunity to use it at all.
Consolidate tools. I currently have the ability to collaborate via box, outlook, jabber, webex, and intercall. It would be great if these tools were all more well connected. I.e. box+webex+jabber. Right now box+outlook largely stand alone from jabber+webex from a document collaboration POV.
Better integration between WebEx and Outlook for Mac. When I had a Windows computer it was much easier to add WebEx/dial-in to a meeting. More importantly, every conference room on campus should have the same AV equipment.
Not sure since I rarely use it. I guess make it more accessible and promote awareness that it is an option.
Not applicable for me to comment upon at this time due to lack of use historically.
Not sure you can - it's already pretty easy.  If I were to be picky, I would mention the possibility of more video chats.  Not sure that is used too much.
It could be better organization for telling you who is connected and who is speaking.
I currently utilize virtual meeting tools, and don't see any major gaps with current resources.
I actually don't even know what tools Nike has for virtual meetings. I usually ask external partners for their WebEx or Blue Jeans options.

Leverage training with few steps, clear, and concise to the end users. More communication could work.
Provide better documentation on getting WebEx installed. It's quite cumbersome to add it as an add-on to the Office Suite and have it available to add to meetings. Many employees don't have this enabled because it's too difficult.
Make the technology tools more seamless. Collaboration is still a challenge when there's more than 5 people in the call/meeting/video
Enable more meeting rooms with the technology

Better webcam capabilities
Extend access
Perhaps have rooms specifically built for web/virtual meetings (larger screens, cameras attached to the screens that pan over the whole room) so that we don't have to shuffle around with equipment, microphones, computers, etc. and can have a more seamless conference environment.
We prefer to meet in person, need to see and touch the product

Centralize on one platform.  There are to many products in the environment which causes confusion.
replace wired Jabra headsets with wireless headphones
Bluejeans availability is not widely communicated, what would also help with meetings that have rotating hosts (e.g. we're hosting bi-weekly office hours for several of the tools that our team owns and operates to which people are dialing in to) is the ability to have a "shared" meeting host, similar to a shared email inbox. This way ownership of a specific WebEx/Bluejeans account could be easier delegated and shared with multiple people. if there are alternative features that would enable this capability I'd be very curious to learn more about those.  thanks!

Better infrastructure on campus to host.

One touch launch of virtual meeting experience

training
Have training sessions available monthly so new users can join in without scheduling
its fine as is
Launch a simple tool globally that everyone uses
Easier to execute. Too much dependence on working technology. Our team has tried to use this functionality, but the technology did not work in the room.
IM has not been working via VPN since the update to Okta. That can make discussions with others in the meeting a challenge.
I have not had issues with Webex except when we use the Clickshare in some cases.
Improve audio quality

Have dedicated video calling in most meeting rooms
uptime
inform the managers, as well as the staff that this is an option and moving forward with technology. emphasize it will save time and might boost participation as well as attendance in store meetings. make it available for all.
The group I work in is all in close proximity so we are typically all able to physically attend meetings. Not a huge need for virtual meeting options.
Meeting virtually in my business does not work. We need face to face in person meetings.
Training on the Tool
Making it easily Accesible
More information / communication on it. Not many people are familiar with it or what the benefits of using it are.
N/A, don'y currently use any virtual meeting tools outside of a phone.
Better tools for Whiteboard/collaboration. Webex is limited, and most of our meetings are tech/arch meetings that require us to talk and collaborate.
facetime opportunities, more rooms in the workplace to facilitate that
better/clearer/louder sound to and from the speaker phone boxes. It is very hard to hear when conferencing in from a phone
"1. Load software faster, improve performance
2. Integrate voice with screen sharing 
3. Definitely improve sound quality to avoid background noise 
4. Provide wireless blue tooth headsets to people."
It's pretty easy to use as it is
stick to one tool and having multiply tools makes it hard to know which one I should be using
I think it actually works fine if you have good wifi connectivity. I have not explored using it via smartphone/tablet but that would be great. We are moving in to a Freestyle environment soon so I expect this will be very useful going forward.
Allow it to be a little user friendly or allow it to work consistently.  There are moments when it did not work and we had to call someone which took over an 1 hour to get assistance
Use the tool to call through your computer rather than requiring a conf line (phone)

Better sound quality through Webex. In a large room setting, lot of echo or sometimes never heard
Audio quality is always a challenge.  I realize you don't have control over every aspect of that, with cell phone usage, etc., but I do notice that the newest conference room AV setup has much better quality than the older conference (star) phones do.  So as you replace the older phones, the audio should improve.
All conference rooms have video-conferencing.  All video-conferencing equipment works the same way.  Reliable bandwidth/connections.  Training/Job aids.
All employees need access to evolved collaboration tools. It should be part of employee orientation and all employees should be trained on the basic tools. The amount of time that is spent sharing information that gets ingested into a spread sheet, keynote, ppt, email notes and then having to re-calibrate against that info week after week while each team leverages unique tools (either non-collaborative, or siloed off from the rest of the org) - there is no way we will get to 50B with the current reliance on non-collabration tools or product roadmaps that are 2-4 years long.


Ensuring conference rooms are always in working order when trying to connect to the screen/tv
Ensure technology (TVs, cameras, phones) are working properly in meeting/breakout rooms.

more trainings and conference rooms set up with proper items needed
I prefer looking people in the eye when I have meetings.  Handshakes go a long way.  Too easy to get distracted when joining virtually.  You cannot change that.

Make it easier to set up a webex call- make more consistent streaming between devices
N/A
The biggest problem I have with virtual meeting is the VOIP drops me out of the conference at least once every meeting I attend. Improving our ability to use VOIP would be super helpful.
Better tools...more information about the tools...keep everyone up to date on the latest and greatest tools used within Nike.
Use Slack for calls, chat, and screen sharing
Make it easier to set up a virtual meeting
Its hard to have phone conversations at my desk, its an open space and is very noisy.  There are very limited conference rooms where you can sit quietly to hear/talk.  Need more quiet space for this to be an option for me.
create more video conference rooms so we can better connect with our teams globally

The biggest drawback to virtual meetings is the ability to build relationships and see non verbal communication.  If we can solve for that, it would expand
Personally I feel that if being able to incorporate the meeting on a platform that could be use across any device would be helpful. We're such a mobile company that we need an easier way to connect with our computers, phones, or tablets.
Training and Knowledge
Most of the conference rooms we could meet virtually in have a tech issue.... TV doesn't work, or volume, or its too dark.
Webex incorporated into more standard apps
tips and tricks should be documented and sent out


The tools available work great, we just don't have anyone working remotely very often
Webex is a good tool to meet virtually plus it has all good options like share desktop, call me etc
Dialing into meetings via computer is unreliable.  It seems to be due to poor wifi connections and/or poorly configured computers
Creating educational, accessible materials for those who don't know how to use virtual meetings software, and make sure the UI is easy and conducive for supporting virtual meetings.
Virtual Meetings require headset/ headphones. Air MI still uses desk phones, we should switch to Microsoft Lync for Business. Much easier to link into meetings utilizing our Microsoft Office Calendar.
Tie it into conference equipment. Virtual Collaboration / White boarding

Better audio connection, people consistently have problems hearing
more accessible
works well for me
More conference rooms equip with this feature
More video calls or skype meetings, allow us to see who we are talking with

quicker way to get into the phone bridge
VR headsets? Honestly it's hard to innovate a technology to be more immersive when the device you are using doesn't lend itself to that experience
Increased functionality to allow remote access into participant computers to teach them how to use different tools.
Works for me as is

Improve conference room connectivity.
Difficult to hear speakers and the information being provided.  Have to have people frequently repeat themselves.  This seems more with the WebEx/Conference calls.  It's also people with connectivity issues and not being able to hear them as well (if they are remote and you are in a conference room)

More seamless set up. Activate Voip so we don't have to use desk phone systems. Accessible anywhere.


Easier access and user interface
Screen Sharing , White Boards and better voice quality
Better connectivity between tools
Make Ipads available to use.  Sometime you need your computer for the meeting and conference rooms are not available.
Better connectivity. Hot spot options.
NA
Better internet connectivity in all NIKE buildings, in the USA and overseas. Also, being able to video conference easily.  These are the biggest issue, limiting meeting effectiveness.  We need better communication across the company about tools available, how best to leverage them, or even how to use them.  Not everyone is a millennial that's grown up with an iPad in their crib.  Some of us still remember life before email, the "world wide web," and mobile phones being the size of a toaster.
Network limitations make the virtual meeting pause and jump frequently creating frustration.

Better connection for voice communication
We need more video conferencing rooms available
Audio is very poor on most calls.
I have no idea.
Virtual meetings are fine.


Have it available in more than 2 areas in our building
Volume - it is difficult to hear for those that are on the phone.

Provide training sessions for those who are unfamiliar with the technology to ensure that they know how to use it.
Install more of them....hard to find an open room.
Better Tools.
Easy to use video conferencing
No major complaints. When we have calls with Asia the phone lines sometimes have static which makes it hard to hear each other.
Make it as easy as / analogous process to simply allocating a (video) bridge number to each person, and when attendees dial into that number from a video conference enabled room, all their settings kick in and the meeting starts.
Have more rooms set up with big screens
Increase reliability and reduce lag/latency.  Make it easier to do ad-hoc - like texting, except with video.

Make sharing files easier
Easier way to call in and plan it through Outlook
More "live" features - like teleconference.  It's always nicer to put a name with a face.

Calls with other geos can be difficult due to language gaps
have more video support for large groups
It can be hard to hear if you're not in the room, and hard to interject input.  I guess the virtual meeting experience could be improved by coming up with solutions to those issues.

more dedicated rooms, spaces or stations that support virtual meetings.  screens that are regularly calibrated, screens big enough to show work/product well, speakers.
Video conference would be great.
I use screen share a lot (jabber) but voice is always on the phone. Is it possible to have voice and visual together? It was the same when I used Webex Meeting with so many audience in different countires and was cumbersome.
Ease of access and setup.  Most of us are simply intimidated by the logistics.  Having tutorials would help.
Working well for me now.
n/a. I am really satisfied with the experience!
allow you to control calls through the intercom/speaker system from your own computer
It would be great if setting up an account was easier.
more video conferencing; tv screen connections in many conference rooms don't work well
Training on the tools for our team
"Quick and simple interface. 

Usually in conference rooms there are different controls to choose from. If we could SIMPLIFY our options that would ideally help. We usually have a phone + video conference pad to select from. It would be less challenging and intimidating if everywhere were on one tool. For example, an ipad that could be used to dial into calls + video conferencing."
It works well as it is

by utilizing more virtual tools. Possibly using cameras on laptops to join in meetings.
Quite often you have several ways to set up and join Webex meetings. Usually it is the last way you try that actually works
It is hard to ask questions in the virtual meeting.
An upgraded WIFI connection in every meeting room would do the trick
Have more small spaces that are private

Better audio
Just make it easier to use - though I do not meet with many people ouside of WHQ. When I do, it is just via phone call.
audio and projection systems in campus meeting rooms need to be 100% functional to allow groups to meet virtually with other teams - webex can function great but if the audio quality is not good in a conf room then the meeting is not productive
More conference rooms with VC available. Multiple screens so when sharing content the view of participants isn't smaller.
Employee training for old and new employees.

no issues
More video conferencing
Make it a bit more user friendly to set up
Ensure all new employees are trained in how to setup and use virtual meetings.
More video conferencing available at WHQ and overseas locations to encourage team engagement. Ensure all room screens are always working.
Put video conferencing equipment in every conference and meeting room!  Make it easier for all employees to have conference bridges and encourage employees to use both conference call bridges and/or video conferences for every meeting.
reduce number of steps to perform
To roll out a clear action plan on how many options we have for attending mettings and to enable workspaces with the propper tech or encourage people to be more familiar with Webex mainly.
Maybe if people knew some of the deeper WebEx features better - but it is still difficult to replicate face-time with people
video conferencing
It works pretty well.
More reliable Webex connections, more bandwidth
I have never used it.
Phone delays are sometimes present people are spread across various regions, which leads to people talking over each other inadvertently.  Phone reception is poor in the building.
The current virtual meeting experience is quite good but it would be great if there were a one click dial in through any device, personal phone, laptop, polycom etc
Provide access and training to all employees.
Better telecom system in meeting rooms, easier to set up Dial In's, Cultural shift towards being able to collaborate remotely.

Placing conference room numbers on the telecoms can make the call back feature easier and thereby avoiding having to enter so many numbers.
change cultural at Nike that it is acceptable.
provide suggestions for downloading successfully in meeting details for external partners who do not use webex frequently
Provide clear explanation about WebEx: How to set up initial access. How to set up own WebEx account to use for meetings I host. How to use WebEx for desktop/file sharing during meetings. The explanation/instructions in Nikepedia are unclear.
I find them easy to use, but it's just not widespread yet.  I have had more recently so hopefully its spreading.
Hard to set up a meeting, especially if it's recurring
Provide iPads to all employee's for easier accessibility from mobile locations. Phone is small and laptops are not always ideal to set up in time. A tablet is an easier option to carry, set up and view other participants. Always have programs that allow for multiple video calls. I believe BlueJean is a great way forward.
need more video conference rooms for external meetings/calls
To have better video conference calls. I think someone being on a video helps keep them engaged with the people that are in a room or others on the call.

Encourage use of virtual meetings across all teams. Make it easy to use and have all equipment working
"Need more HDVC rooms. 
I worked in MJ2, there isn't one on my floor, MJ3 and MJ4 are restricted access."

Make the scheduling for WebEx available on a mac - I have to log onto the site and set it up ahead of time via the website then update the invite with the information. Would be nice if there was the option to set it up directly in Outlook.
Promote a greater culture and value for telecommuting, freestyling and using virtual meeting tools.
better sound quality with systems in conference rooms. Better white boarding and/or screen sharing
Webex works pretty well. Anytime we can integrate tools together like Jabber and Webex, all the better. We have so many different apps and web pages to go to sometimes.
We use webex for almost every meeting especially since half the team is co-located and it can be a challenge to get to each building within minutes. Never had issue with webex but the challenge is often hearing folks on the speaker phone. Better conference phones would really help as folks often sound quiet or muffled.

Make conference rooms more consistent, stable and easy to use.  Enable easy video conferencing from your laptop.
guides on how to set up/easier to set up
I've had better experience with Uberconference.

having more information on zero on how to do a webEx meeting, how to set up or tutorial. This probably already exists but setting the tool in a more visible area so more would utilize.
The meetings I've attended within my org doesn't typically call for virtual meetings (as of yet)
Easier process to set up, in-person conference rooms more enabled with tools for these meetings
N/a
With majority of my counterparts and business stakeholders located within walking distance, the need for virtual meetings is minimal. However, when I have meetings with associates located globally (mainly UK) we set up phone calls, as those individuals are usually on the road, and the easiest way to chat is via phone, not web-ex. The virtual meeting experience could be improved with increased education on the tools, and how to use them! As in my experience, the barrier to use has been due to lack of knowledge on how to get the tools to function and operate!
Increase ease-of-use across all platforms (meeting room VC, mobile device, pc/mac)

Improve the ease of accessibility
ip phone. make sure people can use it...it is so frustrating that it takes 10 minutes to get everyone signed into a webex.


Unfortunately, not all HDVC room set ups are the same.  Seems there is a slight nuance to them and its frustrating and just can't be counted on.
I am not aware of any support or training for this technology.
Pick a tool that loads faster. Webex takes a lot of time to start.
better audio technology. sometimes its very difficult to tell what is being said
Pick ONE standard or the ENTIRE enterprise (Webex or Bluejeans, even Skype for Business, since it's paid for already with O365). Promote it. Train users.
Make sure connecting to other conf rooms around the world are easier / clearer directions / make sure both visual and audio connections are current and working
Make it more visible - links and access. Make it easier to set up and use. More instructions.
As a culture we need to better understand meeting etiquette and invest in much better telephony/video equipment that works consistently.




Get more people to use it, teach more people to use it, provide video conference capabilities - lack of video conference capabilities is surprising in 2017.
Actually have it.
Send auto generated meeting recaps at the close of the session to all attendees/non attendees.

it's a mind set shift for team to start using virtual meeting technologies rather than tool itself. most of the times people like to have some F2F rather than talking over virtual meeting tools which has to changes (comes with cultural shift).
Make it easier for Host of recurring mtgs. to hand off 'ownership' of mtgs. when Host is out or unavailable.
I think it works great. No complaints
Integrate it along with other technologies. Use one unique all purpose platform
I've had great experiences with VC/CC meetings with my NLO/Factory teams. I would love the ability to do it from my computer remotely, like Jabber Video used to allow us to do. If we have that ability still, but through another software, I'd like to know.
Make sure it's accepted and endorsed by leadership.  These are great tools but if leadership doesn't use them, then it's a waste of money.
Remove the need to call in as an addition to using the webex
none
Make the setup more seamless. In my experience when I have tried to use it in conference rooms it is not a straightforward experience for getting started.

Slack or screenhero-like tools.
"Here in Vietnam, internet speed is the biggest barrier to using virtual meeting tools. Often times WebEx is slow and has trouble connecting. 

Also, Avaya office phones are not readily available, especially at factory partners where many employees work. This makes it challenging to join conference calls."
Sound quality is always something that can be improved.

Using computer as a source of phone calls as well
The first biggest step is to encourage managers to encourage their team to start using that more. However, I think the way it's also more convenient if it's convenience (and easy way to use it) is communicated more. Even though I just started here a a few weeks ago, I feel like some teams just live in their own bubble.
let it be used throughout all employees
More conference rooms with virtual software
Use some more visual option - preferably white boarding.

Require that teams always use virtual meetings and always have recordings available for later viewing.
Use one Tool instead of many
User friendly Video conferencing
Perhaps more trainings on how to use these resources
provide easy to access resources to train/teach/show how to use it.  most times it feels like we have software/tools available to use, but it's difficult to find tools to show how to use it properly and efficiently.
Consistent tool usage would be helpful, as would easy access to tools from all common meeting spaces.
CONSIDER USING ZOOM- GREAT VIRTUAL TOOL

WebEx doesn't work seamlessly for everyone across all operating systems and devices.  About 30% of the time either I or others on my team have issues using it.  Also, I'd like more opportunities to meet remotely via video.
I like it and think it works great!
The equipment in conference rooms never seem to work correctly. In our building, we have challenges in 90% of our conference/focus rooms with the technology, limiting our ability to project webex video.
Sometimes difficult to find a conference room to have multiple people attend virtual meetings together.
Put these tools in more athlete hands!
Connections are usually spotty, difficult to hear speakers, lots of interruptions cuz noone knows who is or wants to speak up next
More wider education of the tools available and ease of use. Teams that use it regularly use it well, others not familiar with it will err on the side of not using
There should be training on virtual meeting as part of on boarding. Also virtual meeting etiquette.
good for now
Easier experience to set up meetings with external partners
Linking with phones, computer app similar to skype, link computer app and phone app together
Record conversations for later review by participants. Helps to retain details of meetings
make sure everyone knows what tools are available, how to use them and make sure the group culture supports virtually meeting. Make it easy, the fewer steps the better. Make sure it is secure and everyone knows how secure.
While I use Webex and Slack for my virtual meetings today, I need to further self-educate myself on BlueJeans and Slack video conferencing with multiple participants.  Slack video conferencing with another participant is super-slick, but Slacking with multiple participants is new.



More HDVC rooms. The biggest issue is finding a room with HDVC that is available or is a public room I am able to book vs. a private room
"Less numbers to dial-in. 

Simultaneous phone and video connectivity versus having to call-in separately from WebEx.

Less confusing way to forward meeting details to participants.  Seems easier to do with Windows tools versus Mac."
"Wifi seems to be saturated or have latency on EG2. So on virtual meetings i use the desktop and phone line, just inconvenient. 
People normally do not display what is going on. either a deck, agenda or video
Most people do not have digital practices, sharing notes, screen-sharing, annotation, chat room. White boards are normally used by not shared
Audio quality is poor on conference rooms for more than 5 people.
Too many different tools, blue-jeans, sococo, slack, jabber, webex, gotomeeting
Conference rooms not optimized for using the tools. Quick start buttons, auto dial, video display."
I don't know if i am able to setup virtual meeting experience. Create a one-pager showing who, how, when it can be used.
Have a single tool that all GEOs use. Some use WebEx some use Bluejeans it's hard to learn the ins and outs of each tool. Most times you don't realize what tool is being used until the start of the meeting. Also, it would be nice if there were training's and better communications around the purpose of moving tools. I was on the beta test for Skype for business was never advised that we were not moving forward with the tool.
Improved video conference quality. Picture quality, audio quality, connection speeds and reliability.
Join notifications always go to clutter or junk email box, so it is hard to find sometimes.
Simplify integration with video equipment in conference rooms
consistency in tools

Better connection and with call conference better sound(is very bad can't understand nothing)

How do do teams know more than Webex? This is never socialized on other tools available.
provide more video conferencing rooms
Improve the connection on conference calls
AV Connectivity in Conference Rooms is very finicky (e.g. plugins for laptop to project are shoddy), which makes gathering a group of people on the same team inefficient to participate in the conversation
Make it as frictionless as possible
Meeting facility should be good enough.
Video chat capability and be able to share notes after the meeting
multiple conference rooms with video conferencing capabilities



Train employees and educate them on the benefits.
Video conferencing still seems difficult to use/figure out how to use - so often we just default to phone instead.
Use more commonly-used tools in the non-business world (skype, etc.)
Have more spaces which are equipped for virtual meetings. Additionally, have spaces that are equipped for 1-2 people virtual meetings. All the spaces are set up for much larger groups, but I often have meetings myself and one other person and it's difficult to find a small, quiet space that is more private than my desk.
Hard to exchange visual information back and forth. (One way is usually fine)
Adapt one/two technologies that are used throughout Nike
Improve the internet band
Not sure, haven't used virtual meetings at Nike
I enjoy the current tools, and do use them occasionally. The majority of my meetings are so close, I really haven't had the need to rely on this technology.
Constant feedback loops and reminders that services are available
Make it easier to access

Rip the bandaid off. Give everyone BlueJean, remove all WebEx and other tools and train everyone the same week. We take way too long to roll out new tools and the roll out is spotty and therefore the uptake and acceptance is spotty.

integrate phone and webex
it just needs to work from all devices
Easier integration of (real) whiteboard use.  Our meetings tend work better in-person, because we are working with many different functions and almost always working on process solutions, requiring hands-on facilitation and whiteboard sessions.
lapel microphones so people on the phone can hear better
Better Audio.   My hearing isn't the best, have conference calls with people with accents... this makes understanding and following the conversation difficult at times. better microphones and speakers might help? is there any technology that would automatically generate subtitles?
More cams in the conf rooms. Switch from being laptop-centric on a video conf, to room-driven and integrated with the in-house phone systems.  And/or make Apple FaceTime compatible for people wanting to join the meeting.
Training on how to use the equipment. More rooms with VC equipment in the room, sometimes hard to find a room VC equipment.
More encouragement to teams.  I just learned about Blue Jeans recently.  Always include a video conference link.  Make it an expectation that if you are remote, you use video.
N/A

N/A
More video conference rooms available
Ensure that the live streaming and or wifi bandwidth can hold for the duration of the meeting.   Always allow for a recording/playback option
Allowing everyone athletes included to attend a webinar
Keep equipment updated in conference rooms.  Make phone lines easier to use.


Improve the quality of video/audio/and screensharing. Figure out a way to see people in the room as well as content so I can read people's reactions through body language...
I rarely used
being able to see your coworkers
How-To guide on how to operate Webex, etc.... Also central source of actual HDVC rooms that work.
Make them easier to set up and interface with
More simplicity in bringing large rooms into the video experience. IE video conferencing that brings work from home into the conference room with the others.
I have a lot of experience with virtual meetings from other companies, but it doesn't seem to be a part of Nike culture.  In fact, in Eric Sprunk's comments in the Friday All Hands meeting, he talked about how Nike is (and will remain) a "collegial environment" where we collaborate in person on a campus.  Telecommuting and virtual meetings don't seem to be supported from the top down.  However, those things represent the future of the workplace (along with freestyle) at most progressive companies.
Let all new hires get a short introduction to how to set up webex
Make it easier to use and don't change it from vendor to vendor so often.

better internet connections (faster)
Connection speed
Provide an integrated virtual meeting tool that was not disruptive to existing workflows.
Not applicable in my role, but open feedback is great!
Simplified setup and instructions
Make it possible or more consistent for the system to call and connect all of the meeting participants to the virtual meeting

video conferencing like google hangouts

When doing onboarding,  tell people about the tools.  No one in my team uses them,  when i needed to use had to figure out on my own
Improve wifi network connectivity in meeting rooms so video doesn't freeze and audio doesn't get interrupted
Slack integration.
All stores need to be equiped with the correct technology. As when I first had to use blue jeans, we had no ear phones with built in speaker so I couldn't get involved in the call as no other team members could hear me. Also our webcam is old, so does work 100% of the time.

My team does not use...
N/A
I think the move to BlueJeans is a great step, I would say upgrading more of the rooms to be AV ready with BlueJeans hardware would be a great step.
I don't need to work virtually as I sit with my team.


Make it easier to navigate for those who are less tech savvy

Inconsistent performance, lack of equipment-specific directions, and missing laptop connection tools between meeting rooms means we rarely use the meeting room technology, instead relying more on phone conferences and WebEx.
Please document how employees can host virtual meetings of their own.

mobile
I don't really know how it works or that it's available. It would be beneficial to understand all the things that are available to us and make them easy to use.
n/A
Not sure.  It is easier to have a conference call if the meeting cannot be held in person.
Give AV teams better tools.
NA
Offer a service that enables employees to use webcams from his / her laptop;  We also need more meeting rooms to be able to have a virtual meeting with some level of privacy
I think it's more of a culture thing in Design. We don't do conference calls or webex meetings very often. Everything is in person or not at all.
Continuity. Some people use Blue Jeans, some use WebEx...I never quite know which one to master and which one to offer first.
have more rooms with the Virtual Meeting ability

I am very comfortable with WebEx and conference calls. I have never used video conference, but out team has the support it needs if we ever did.

Provide cameras as part of the standard desk setup.  Just like a 2nd monitor is pretty much standard for everyone in product creation.  Do the tools work well with communications to Asia?  More education on how to best use the tools.
I think it does it's job well...haven't had any issues
More video camera rooms so we can see the other attendees. That face-to-face connection (even on camera and not in person) makes communication easier.
more face-to-face tools
consistent tools in each of the conf rooms.  currently there seems to be several different kinds of sound systems used throughout the buildings.
Provide ideas how users can optimize virtual meeting experiences.  Eg... When is it best to use WebEx versus Blue Jeans?
Provide more information and access to this tool

Working in a freestyle space we have limited access to a room appropriate for virtual meetings. Having easy access to a small meeting space, that is private and does not distract the others in the area would be very helpful.
faster speeds (in vietnam), network isn't the best
Use Blue Jeans application - my colleague in Europe loves it and introduced this to me last week.  it is great...no phone needed...
Make people use it!!!

It's always difficult to clearly hear everyone when I call into a conference.
WebEx generally works very well for those of us joining remotely, but if some people are in a conference room and some remote, the screen shared on the room projector is often clunky and delayed.

?
quicker to access, quicker to process through to "call me" on webex
Have all the virtual experiences across campus consistent and the same.
More private meeting spaces so that it is less noisy and distracting in the background and more confidentiality/privacy
It strange, other companies I have worked for have endorsed this technology and pushed people to use it as an incentive to being more free, (Work from home, etc...) Nike is the first company where no one uses these tools. They don't even think to include simple dial-ins in meetings even know they can do it with one click.
Training.
"The quality of connections. 
The convenience to set up a virtual meeting."
Tie the conference call and WebEx together better.
I'm not familiar enough with available options to provide feedback in this area. Typically the biggest problem is conference rooms are issues trying to present on the in-room monitor/screen.



I don't have much experience with the virtual meeting tool, but have heard that folks say it is inconsistent to use.  Most of my meetings are typically in person, and fairly close to my desk area.
Get us Blue Jeans
Inform and communicate the workforce on how to operate the tool
Make it virtually effortless to use...click, done!
The touchpads often do not function in the video conference rooms in Mia Hamm. There is also not a great solution for video conference calls with outside partners. Skype often malfunctions. InterCall works well for conference calls, but sometimes the visual component would be very helpful.
walk through sheets to ensure proper use of software and equipment, not all rooms are the same
Speed, ease to connect
I believe it's very high quality. We just don't have many virtual meetings in my department.
While great for frequent users, there is a set up and access challenge for those who use it less frequently.
Audio quality is challenging, especially when people are calling from a freestyle environment, which adds significant background noise

one place for audio and visual.  eliminate the phone aspect.
Standard platform (like WebEx) direct from my MAC or cell phone with minimal setup time

It would be great to have a primer and FAQ on WebEX. It rarely works when novices pilot it.
Video conferencing at WHQ rarely works without difficulty.  Plus I really don't know how to use WebEx, etc.
Video

most of my partners work within a few buildings; I don't need to connect with virtual meetings
Streamline the process, allowing others to join more easily, and make sure the tools we use and connections are strong enough to make it seem less virtual.
More intuitive display connections in all conference rooms.
WebEx usually works well for collaboration, visual communication, and training

more common adoption... seems like there are several available platforms, and since it's unclear who's on what, some consolidation may be useful.
Not familiar enough with it.

Less HDVC and more WebEx and other tools that can be accessed by a variety of devices.
Consistent technology in all meeting rooms. Easier to set up Virtual Meetings from within Outlook
Have a quick guide/trouble shooting guide in the conference rooms that have the virtual meeting capabilities.
When using WebEx, if the WebEx window is closed, the conference call is also disconnected.  Can a setting be added to prevent the conference call from ending if the WebEx window closes?
ensuring that everyone at Nike is on the same platform. Maybe a training on how to use all the tools in Webex.
A friendlier user interface/a tool that's easier to use.
Easier to find a space with a conference room and working large screen, need to be able to have people in meeting and on the webex.  Training for Webex.
Improve audio capabilities within conference rooms to improve quality and range of coverage so that dial-in participants hear more of the discussion happening in the room.
Make it easier to login. A separate issue, making an easy seamless wifi projector for laptop screen would be great for meetings. Usually we spend 5+ minutes hooking things up, or someone has taken the cords and adapters! Intel created its own "Unite" conference room computer and they don't have any problems at all. Perhaps you can buy it from them?
Make it simpler to connect (ie automatically connect and then recognize you so that you don't have to enter the Conf code).    Make sure all the equipment works and can connect to all laptops in conference rooms that are supposed to host virtual meetings
camera's while your laptop is docked, better integration with conference call system to identify callers
wireless connections to the tools, and more video connections
Better polycom phones and microphones; the audio is usually the hardest part of virtual meetings. Also, it would be nice if all conference rooms had a working monitor (at least two in my building are out of order this month).
Teach me how to use it or allow me to utilize it by incorporating it into my department
None
Better access to GOOD virtual meeting tools. the only good virtual tools I have used were special conference rooms designed for video conferences. These had their complications though as I had to walk everyone through all the steps to connect to eachother. It was very time consuming, and only really worked because it involved territory offices away from WHQ. Most people don't know how to do a video conference, and the rooms aren't easy to access, so it doesn't make sense to use. Other options like webex or intercall are such a low quality that you really fail to get the desired level of participation - If people have to focus all of their energy on hearing and understanding the words that are coming through a phone, they are not ready to be active in a conversation. Another problem, is that people don't want to join these calls and have their voice heard from their desk which would often disturb other people. We need more private work space, or more private rooms to take these conference calls in.
if more people I worked with were on the technology.

Better network speed, tools within meetings room that can serve a virtual meeting, like TV's that work, cables that work for all laptops etc.
easy to set up in meeting rooms- no guessing or trouble shooting required especially when you want to hook up to a monitor
More use of video conference rooms globally
Similar to how BOX has gained traction, if there was a go to format for virtual meetings to take place our team would be more likely to replicate it.
WebEx can be a bit confusing to set up and not as easy to start up as other tools out there.

When using virtual meetings and dial-in phones --- it is VERY hard to hear people on the other end; especially if they are in a conference room.  Constantly asking to have them move closer to the phone
Today the experience is fine, except mabe for the Internet speed in my Store is too low

the sound quality is challenging, especially if there are attendees with accents.  Also, asking questions isn't easy.  Is there a way to signal you have a question without interrupting?
The hassle of taking the time to hook it up, etc.
connectivity issues - always!
Mostly use WebEx. pretty easy to use... not as easy to set up.  perhaps a one page how to would be helpful
Not sure, don't use it often enough
Video?
not sure
try to use webex
Provide better tutorials for how best to take advantage of the tools.
I have a Mac and everything is synced as nicely as a PC, in addition getting knowledgable support it tough.
Make AV equipment more reliable in meeting rooms so you can have meetings that are both virtual and in person (which is common).  Unreliable AV equipment can make it very difficult for online participants to hear.
Simplify login
more training, visibility to the options.



I really like the virtual meeting experience. I just don't need to use it very often.
Suggestion to use Skype for Business - makes it easy (and i think cheaper than our conference line) to make calls and very easy to share screens to host virtual meetings.  The app works well also.
Using video might make the conversations more personal, and if we used more of the collaborative aspects of box of O365, for shared notes, or on the fly sketches would make it feel less like you were "apart" from those in the room.
Need a quick macro to schedule a Webex within the Outlook calendar and load the conference dial in and URL into the meeting invite
Make it easier to schedule WebEx from a group calendar. Upgrade the phone experience as there is a voice delay which causes people to talk over one another.
Better audio quality
unsure as my experience with it limited, found the few times I've used it, it worked well

mobile experiences are key. it's annoying when you have to be tethered to a computer.
Provide adequate technology in each building that works properly; with easy instructions for use.

Faster
Provide clear instructions available in each conference room.  Simplify steps.
Clarify how you'll respond, or if you're able to respond to all questions during live streams or WebEx meetings.
Better conference call connection/noise cancelling
Consolidation of Tools.

Virtual meeting work fine for some types of meetings.  For these types of meetings the technology here at nike is adequate.
Quality of signal/voice quality
less meetings.  make decisions and move forward.  when we do meet - make the virtual meetings super easy.  create bluetooth technology for conference rooms for other people to join easily.
Do More :)
More video-equipped conference rooms to ease technical difficulties
Provide up to date training material on WebEx - both written documentation and video. Show how to integrate with scheduling via Outlook.
Unblock slack video an voice calls as the nike proxy blocks the traffic.
Have one standard platform.
not very many resources available and are in already reserved conference rooms the majority of the time at Oscilate
I am satisfied with WebEx always include it as an option when I know participants are not in the same building.  I have many global meeting and with vendors who do not work on the Nike campus so this is a tool I use every day.
Faster reaction corresponding time between the 2 parties
I think it's just fine
Easier to use.  Usually connectivity issues trump any issues with the actual virtual meeting service.
Better set-ups in existing conference rooms.

Implement workshops to encourage more use.
Further adoption
more information---quick video "how to" tutorials easily located on zero.  I don't want to have to "dig" through zero to locate informational videos.
not sure
Sound quality is important.
I'm not sure. Issues that arise for me generally have to do with mics and volume for sound. It's hard to follow a meeting remotely when other team members are there in person. The experience can be disjointed for those on the phone.

More teams/individuals need to adopt the technology.  Need simplistic instructions on how create/host virtual meetings and how to use the tool (during a meeting).
I have not faced major issues with Virtual Meeting but sometime I feel phone  and speaker quality could be improved.
More Video conferencing capabilities. Its easier to have a conversation if you can see peoples faces and body language

Connections are seamless, easy to use, and technology is good enough that meetings can still be productive. Often, microphones are sub-par making it hard to hear participants. Or, the setup process is not optimal cutting into quality meeting time.
unknown
add in more whiteboarding options.
Ensure working hardware in all meeting spaces. Provide more meeting spaces.
Quality of sound on many calls could be improved.  Having a landline work phone at my desk would be very helpful.  I don't like to use my cell, as I don't get great reception, having to always find a conference room, or small room with a phone is hard and unnecessary, if I had a desk phone.

It's just not widely accepted so most teams shy away from it.
Clean it up a bit. Would be nice for admins to easily schedule a meeting on behalf of their managers -- right now I schedule a webex on my calendar to use for my manager to use. Also would be nice to have the cisco webex suite already downloaded into Outlook with all reimaged computers.
Allow multiple people to collaborate on a team white board or same documents. If we had items that we could write with digitally and show on our screens it would help a ton!
"Working in a large project with a lot of people - it is DIFFICULT to hear and manage the conversations. Especially true with larger groups. It also moves conversations to passive listeners - NOT leaning into the conversation.

 It serves a purpose - but it is NOT a replacement for personal conversation."

I need more time in between meetings I have way to many back to back so it is hard to do all the meetings I have in any way
Make it automatically accessible to all employees and very user friendly.  I've done some virtual meetings and had technical difficulties.
I think Webex is an excellent tool, easy to use, share screens and video capabilities
ability to book private meeting rooms or have access to quiet rooms
Ease of setup and access

n/a.  i really like webex and it's integration with outlook.  our team just doesn't use it.
Better audio from polycom phones in the conference rooms. Additional satellite microphones or better technology. Also offering headsets to participants, since it's difficult to hear people who are on speakerphone from their cell also. Basically a perfect storm of not being able to hear relevant information or participate effectively unless you're physically in the room.
Expand video conferencing to the device/laptop
Better collaborations with external suppliers/vendors by having video equipment that can work outside Nike's firewall.
more videochats. better video capabilities within conference rooms.
Add video conferencing capabilities (RELIABLE ones)
"easy dial to show up in location field in outlook, so access on mobile devices easy
web ex set up on phone easier
default to web ex info available, so we eliminate the need for the meeting requestor to forward at a later date, allowing flexibility for transition from face to face to virtual without additional info
my work has lots of etws, need for etws to be able to use this technology without additional burden to fte team members."
It is difficult to find a meeting room in APCC building with intercom systems that work.
Voice/image issues
Streamlined experience for dial in for all global participants.  The AV in any of the conference rooms typically does not work or doesn't work well.  This should be a seamless experience of "Making the Basics Great".  Video conference should be seamless without latency, dial in or video clarity issues.  Technology should have a tiered approach on which type of conference rooms receive AV and at what level AV will be provided.  i.e. large conference rooms with 10+ participants should have the capability to have the best AV and video conference available vs. a focus room.

One consistent tool so that everyone can be familiar with how it works.
Better/easier connectivity within the rooms
it is good
Align with the technology and how friendly it is on the mobile
Better training and VC capabilities in conference rooms.
Better support for integrated services (desktop sharing while calling, etc)
Easier to go through
communication
I'm comfortable and well assisted for the virtual meetings we have today.
better equipped meeting rooms for audio
possibly as a work-at-home option, otherwise not sure it's needed in the area I work in.
Simplify the meeting setup and use. A brief virtual tour would be helpful.
It would be nice to see everyone that's logged on to the call.  It displays the name but a lot of time it's just "caller 1", "caller 2".   Not sure who is talking
Conference call audio is choppy sometimes.
make it more like 'go to meeting' application.  The current is not as intuitive and for some users it is challenging to recall how to navigate effectively at the time of the meeting....
Higher quality video tools, available via desktop. Better quality audio conferencing.
Being able to view participants as well as shared documents.
The only difficulty I have had with virtual meetings is when the group needs to review a document through WebEx.  The results are varied depending upon the expertise of the person who is running the meeting.  Perhaps greater visibility into training tools for Webex users would help.

By circulating a tip sheet on how to use popular features, and other features that are less known, but which are handy.

Decrease the tedious extra steps to start a conf call.
Use computer to do full webex (audio and camera and share screen) instead of complex IP address system
By having the "bat phone" in every room working and connected.  The regular Avaya desk style phones do not always do well with multiple line connection.  They are often time less clear than the flat conference style phones.
USING ONE TOOL RATHER THAN 5
The tools we use are good (Webex for example) but the hardware is challenging. I often find myself in a room with a malfunctioning VC system or projector.  I also think making training materials on how to use the hardware more accessible would be helpful.

Promote it more to teams

Make it easier to set up and use single sign on
For the times we do use it, it seems pretty easy so no real suggestions from my end.
Upgrade the video conferencing equipment, directories, etc.  Too much time is spent trying to connect.
Camera's in all meeting rooms for a visual meeting (so you can see the people you are talking to).  Television setup's that actually work correctly when sharing your desktop.
Audio / Video quality tends to be poor
Nothing to improve as system we have today are good, conf call and webex

Not sure, works well for me.
Faster setup, ensure connection is consistent, improve audio (poly-com)

More bookable rooms and user friendly setup. Often times meetings are behind schedule because IT needs to be called.

Video conf equipment in more rooms
allow 2-way collaboration instead of just 1-way presentation
Make it easier to use.
don't use it


I'm on a Global Team and we use WebEx multiple times a week.  The screen sharing is invaluable and necessary for what we do, but we would also like to have video conferencing as well.  We've been trying for months to find a way to do video conference and screen sharing at the same time, but continue to come up short.  We need an easy to use and reliable system that allows for calling in, sharing screen AND video conferencing all in one tool.
WEBx tool is used and good. But, we would like to be able to share the screen and video conference at the same time. We currently use two laptops on our WEBx calls - one laptop is used to share full screen data (on one of our presentation screens) and the other laptop is used to share the camera (which is shown on the other presentation screen).  We like to have both and share both data and camera.
More availability and more direction on what is available
The virtual meetings are super difficult because you can't see people. If we could have more reliable video conferencing it would make things so much easier.
Simplify the process to connect screens virtually. Voice connections are smooth, but video connections can be challenging depending on the room and equipment.


Create easily accessible simple training on how to run it.  Some people won't try it without some training.  Some won't try it unless they are forced to try it.  (So, offer mandatory training that involves users actually running a virtual meeting).
the sound is usually terrible and it's difficult to hear if the room is not configured properly (where the meeting is taking place)  also, making it easier to use and MORE DEPENDABLE - getting the meetings started up can take 5-10 minutes sometimes due to issues.
"I would like to have better connectivity to view monitors in conference rooms
More than half the conference rooms that I use have broken cords that are attached to the large monitors.

This also helps when sharing screens over web/ex"
speed
With an introductionary video or easy instructions
One click login. Sometimes too many steps to get a meeting started.
have a informal training
improve reliability of tools and connectivity
Have it available in more locations.
Having to go though less options when dialing in (ie. "say your name after the tone"). Facilitating that everyone try jabber or whatever is the supported tool, too many times there is someone saying "i am not sure I have it"
incorporate more of it, have it just be avaliable
Improve connection. At times, WebX will not load which will cause a delay in the presentation.
Virtual meetings are hard to build a connection through, a visual chat function with web cams would help ensure that the meeting is being taken in and not just back ground noise for another project.




I have had good experience with Webex meetings.  Much of what I do seems to benefit from face-to-face interaction, so I will try and attend in person where possible.  Video conferencing systems available have never been easy to use or consistently available, so I don't use them.
Have a virtual video, easy setup and usage instructions - user friendly, technical hiccups answered as part of FAQ's
Make the experience as close to a "one-click" set-up a possible.

Easier dial in for conference calls.  And easier log into webex.  When on my phone I have to try to remember the conference code # and webex meeting number in the meeting invite to then manually enter then when dialing in and logging onto webex.  Very cumbersome and time consuming.
It's getting better, but having a more unified system with easier to add meeting invites would be helpful.
The times we've used it have been great. Easy to use/set up.
use Zoom.us

Provide a clear and concise process and instructions
I love WebEx when others set it up, but have lost my own login information...probably just need to take the time to set up a new account!  It would be awesome if every Nike user automatically had a WebEx account that they could easily access and add to meetings at the click of a button.  Know that's a lot to ask for, but a girl can dream! :)
Make it easier via Jabber or some tool that tied to our Tech stack
More visual presentation. Screen sharing.
Make it more accessible to everyone

Blue Jeans works better with the international teams I work with.
I find Webex to be very difficult to figure out and technology is my specialty.

Ease of navigation
The current Webex tool can be challenging to those who do not use frequently, and can be glitchy, when video, specifically, or shared screens are involved.
Increased video options and quality of polycomm
Need better connections.   Usually, we can't hear, or see the speakers.  Also with webex it will go down while watching.
Continued education on the various platforms and how to use them.  Conference rooms need to be equipped (and working).
Make it easier to find "How To" one-pagers on Zero. Create easy to read/brief one-pager instructions to get set-up.
Make it automatic to include phone/webex info in all meeting invites. Conference rooms better outfitted with microphones within room to hear. Often meetings are large and this makes it difficult to hear, participate in virtual meetings.
Make it more straight forward and provide instructions in every conference room.
Improve the conference call audio quality as it picks up lot of static noise

connect easily and improve the sound quality
It works pretty well for now.  I wish there were less prompts for the the conf line dial in.
Explaining the capabilities and giving everyone training on how to set it up would be helpful and promote people using it more often.
More training on how to best use the tools.  I think some people don't know all the features in WebEx.


1.clearly camera  2.easly handle 3.voice clearly
"allow for more types of apps to be used with outside vendors 
within the nike secure network"
Make it easier to connect to.
practice
Integrated apps would be helpful.
It works great
I haven't  had to use WebEx very much. But I have heard from others that Blue Jeans is difficult to use
Implement it more with freestyle managers, however, include attention to neighborhood awareness.
Easier to troubleshoot any issues we may have or training for teams ahead of time
We should have 1 user friendly tool that everyone uses so that use-rate increases and therefore becomes the norm.
The initial log-in and call, connection is a nail biter. Never sure if it is going to work. Could just be tech-phobia.
I feel the only issue is people talking over one another which is part of the virtual experience.  This is more a change of virtual meeting process rather than the tool.

making sure rooms are ready to go, often it's difficult to setup calls/meetings in conference rooms.  no offices to meet in and no phones in some conference rooms
I like WebEx well enough, so it's ok to use, but I'm going to check out blue jean (I haven't heard of it before)
n/a
Easier set up

.
more education
It works great for me!
Improve voice quality, sharing function (data, video, picture), automated note taking, working with people in different time zones is always tough
Better training
Keep the screens working.  Most times, the screens don't work or do not have the proper connectivity adaptors.  And there is no help available or grievance system for improvement
If you wanted more people to use the virtual meeting experience you need an environment that will promote it better. If Nike allowed more remote work to their employees, it will prompt more use of virtual meetings. However, because most people drive to work and are on premise it is better to interact face to face. If Nike promoted remote work I believe they would be in a better position to acquire better talent, while reducing overhead.

a more intuitive user interface
Make the office tools standard in the install of Windows machines so everyone uses the tools the same way.
Have other people besides the "leader" of the call be able to initiate the call
Tell us what Blue Jeans is?
Make technology available in more meeting rooms.
Current tool is good and works as expected.
Make sure everyone puts auto-dial version of phone # in the meeting invite (automatically pauses & dials extensions, etc.).
I don' t need anything fancy for my work...it is good as is
Sometimes joining the WebEx meetings is tough. Would love for a better conferencing system in conference rooms that has better sound.

integration into mobile phone
N/A, haven't had an opportunity to experience the virtual meeting experience
Better video conferencing capability with those who are not using webex would be nice
"Actually my (only) virtual meetings are with Asia about 3-4 times /week where we use HDVC system (in a room) or I use Jabber when I dial in from home/ other location. This works totally fine for me and our teams. The system is easy to use and we just use a bridge no.
Around campus I will try to attend the meeting in person (walk or bike) as dialing in works, but you miss most of the conversations as they focus more on everyone in the room vs the 1-2 people dialing in."
All in all it works well, however, perhaps designated people to help with initial setup to avoid problems connecting.

make it easier to access, learn and make it more widely acceptable within my larger team
Its not a performance issue. I use it when connecting to our Global Partners and it works fine. I just don't use this daily or even weekly.
Make BlueJeans more widely known as an option. It's a much better experience! I had no idea we could use it until this survey.
Better screens/projectors and connecting cables to laptops in meeting rooms, especially in Oscillate (Tek 58)
I think it just needs to be more common practice rather than improving the tools
Training broadcast on how to use the feature and promotion of it on Zero-NikeU


make it easier to share media platforms (i.e. sharing information on computer screens etc) to members in the meeting
We use HDVCs to talk to our team in Asia.  There's sometimes a sound delay or a technical problem on one side.  It's also hard to book rooms.  For local teams, I prefer people be present and attend in person.
Needs to be virtually instantaneous to setup/add new attendee's.  Any delay outweighs the benefits.  Audio needs to be crystal clear as well. As someone with less than perfect hearing, bad audio on virtual meetings makes them painful to participate in.
Promote it more as an option -- provide helpful tips to get people started
update the conference rooms to current technology.  VC's don't always work and even polycoms aren't in every room
Faster connection through VPN
make sure we can use it with external parties
Provide instructions on how to set-up webex meetings for first time users.  The first time setting this up, we googled how to do so and a simple how to tool available with other on boarding tools could be helpful.
roadshow/tips & tricks the various virtual meeting technologies
Ensure connectivity issues are proactively addressed. Have experienced meetings where I can't hear well (meeting room sound issues), or the connection is garbled/pixelated and I've had to dial in via phone to actually hear the meeting taking place while viewing via vidcon.

make it mandatory to use this, we are in the 21st century and this is the only company I've work for, who does not adapt to technology
Easier access anywhere...like Facetime...but still have the ability to share and show screens as well.
education
Better connections, consistent presentation technology (Enzo vs. ClickShare, etc.) in the meeting room where they are hosted.
Make it easier to use. Use FaceTime as a template; only thing that is required is a number. In APLA, a lot of our territories have trouble logging on to webex or having a virtual conference call.
Helping the product creation team that I work on get better aware of what tools are available, how they work and what they would help with.
Hadn't heard of Blue Jean until I was out in our Asia offices and they were talking about that over WebEx
Integration with Office could be better.

More conference rooms with video conferencing availability.
It is a Nike culture thing, people like to be face to face. I would love more virtual meetings.
broader adoption and training on tools
campaign telling people how to register
I need easier whiteboard functionality. Drawing with a mouse on WebEx whiteboard is clunky at best. I now have a Yoga P40 with a stylus so that may help. Haven't tried it yet though. Bottom line: for Virtual Meetings to be more effective, they need improved methods for interactivity. Current solutions work great if just a speaker and a slide show, but not for collaborative working sessions.
Have more of them.  I would  love to be able to attend meetings from wherever I am during the day.
make it easier to sign in and share details on different screens
Whenever I have a virtual meeting (they're rare for me) someone on the team always experiences technical difficulties
Webex can be clunky at times and gets corrupted when the invite gets updated frequently.  BlueJeans is very hard to use and we had a very difficult time getting it to work with global partners.  Would be nice to have an easier tool.
Seems to be fine now


"1. All conference rooms should have polycom with enough mics to reach the whole room. It is not always easy to hear everyone when the host is calling from a large conference room with many in-person attendees.
2. there should be a mechanism for webex (or any other similar tool) to recognize and account for people calling in."
Mobile app for webex


More training
"The time to call-in, to when I am in a conf. call is over 1 Minute long.  Make this very simple by reducing that time;  Also, I would like integration with Outlook so that I can include a WebEx meeting as a part of the conf. call.  

Finally, the WebEx UI is a bit frustrating to use, especially around turning on/off video conferencing."
Seamlessly connect outlook meeting management with webex or other virtual meeting tools.
We typically don't rely upon the chat tools
Most meetings are more effective in person...so see no point to using them when most people in our meetings are within walking distance.  Virtual meetings for on-campus meeting are a bad idea.  Virtual meetings for people who are outside the office could be OK, but most of the time a phone call is much easier then an actual tool and is efficient.
Set better conference defaults  (Short prompts, bridge #==desk #) for everyone by default, etc.
more training and ability to use webex in conference rooms with the confidence it will work.  Equipment is often not working.
Just having more people comfortable with it
I haven't used it enough to know how to improve it.

All employees should have computers with webcams to facilitate more interaction and engagement through video calls.
It is easy to use.  I would not make changes.
Ensure we have the tools, training, and leadership approval to use. Training should include both how to use the equipment as well as how to bet interact within the format for best interactions
Easy access to Video teleconference
Online tutorials and additional training to people to encourage the use of virtual meetings.
lap top is too heavy
Make it easier to dial in - it can take a few minutes at the beginning of each meeting, which can be a big waste across all people meeting. if I could swipe my badge, or enter my NT ID or something... it would be a time savings. Dialing into the phone portion is the biggest time-suck. If you have a big team, you need to know the right leader pin, and the right conference info, so you end up digging around for the info.
WebEx is now integrated with Outlook, so it is much easier than previously.
Understanding and working operations for Bluejeans and Webex would be the first step. And are all conference rooms equipped with this service?
Send specific instructions on the use of the program
Equip more conference rooms with video conferencing and better speaker systems (so people on the phones can hear better).
Connections are difficult.   Audio/video breaks up.

clear sound and video
More conference call rooms
"Well, if you could change the culture to make it ""standard"" for people to use their cameras on webex meetings, I think that would increase connection, reduce travel, and make meetings more effective.  That is a hard one to make happen, though!

Make the process of opening an Intercall number FAR more efficient.  

Get less-annoying hold music while waiting for an intercall to start.

Abandon using BlueJean - thankfully, we use webex in my area but every (and I mean EVERY) conf call I have been on that involves BlueJean involves a lot of lost time getting it to work.

Integrate the computer and phone so when I am taking a call at my desk, I can just use my computer to kick-off both the call and the webex.  (Even if you use your computer to call, or have webex call you, it's still additional steps.)

Get better headset technology that allows me to hear better when taking calls at my desk and that allows me to speak more quietly.  Due to ergonimics (and a neck-issue), spending a fair amount of time in a conference room, looking DOWN at my laptop is painful.  I am in meetings 6+ hours per day, due to the nature of my job.  

Figure out how to connect webex and the video-conference technology in some of the rooms."
I work with a lot of older reps (25-30+ yrs of Nike experience) who are technologically challenged - make it easier and one-click
UA
(1) Would be so much more-- interpersonal + interactive + promote cross-cultural communication & awareness --to have sophisticated video conference equipment setup so virtual participants can see all members in the room; ((2)) Offer a poll at the end of each meeting to collect data and look a trends that can help support future virtual meeting infrastructure decisions; (((3))) Make remote facilitators available, particularly for virtual meetings over 10 people;
Demos
Have the ability to have virtual meeting room set up in each building, give a tutorial on it's ability.
Web ex works well for almost all meetings, except for groups from EHQ.  I'm not sure why that is.
There should be consistency of connecting the phone to the user by asking the user to identify themselves with a code.  We should not have people dialed in who are not identified.  Some tools by vendors allow me to enter my personal call in code, most virtual meetings I attend do not prompt a person to identify them selves on a call.
Training to maximize the tools that we already have.
Seamless sign on.
Provide more rooms with this technology
incorporate video into webex and / or jabber
Make a space deciated only for this type of meeting. Small, soundproof, comfortable room with more that one TV for interaction.
All rooms using same technology
Have every meeting room more equipped.
more training on how to use the tools
Better connection speed
educate more people on the need to use BlueJeans or WebEx

teach teams about its availability and how to use it
Have team training available  on how to use and also have an expert available for easy connectivity.
Overall I think our current systems work well for the small less formal meetings I attend.
Softphone voice calling into WebEx would be great.
Make it super simple and easy for anyone to use - including agency/vendor partners.

Working great. Easy to use
Everything's worked good when using this.
Able to download the content or have it accessible to have or print out.
more awareness by NIKE community on the tool features and ease of use/setup
Provide a button or integration into the Nike phone calendar invites so I can easily hit the button and connect to the conference instead of dialing and entering the passcode and hitting the pound button 15 times.
Get rid of webex, go all in on Bluejeans

Ensuring consistent and working equipment in all meeting rooms. More often than not you find that either the equipment does not work or does not have the right cable/connecter.

MAKE IT FASTER TO CONNECT
make it super simple
Unsure

Better Audio quality
Make VC connection easier
Roll out BlueJeans to everyone and things will be hugely better!
let us know what is available
I like it as is.

Change all the wires in the conference rooms to working ones

don't know
I don't know.
Our team does not use this tool often, but when we do there seems to be buffering/audio issues.
make sure equipment is running and the instruction cards are always ready in the room.  Also, not all regional offices have equipment easily available.
Simplified Video capability for small groups from your desk.
Help better explain how to use it. We used Webex for one meeting but most of the people didn't know how to use it so it ended up just being a conference call on our computers.
We have limited conference rooms in Alberto Salazar and only 1-2 with video capabilities.
we do use it for remote-work situations. We tried a number of tools for remotely pair-programming. Currently we are using Slack as the new version offers desktop-sharing
Better phone connection.
Make it as personal as possible. Video is the best to be able to see faces and the people you work with.


NA
Training for users.
"have troubleshooting information available in the rooms; we need to fix it if the basics don't work
clearer sound; long distance and accents very challenging"
make it more commonly known/accessible
My experience has been good, just not a lot of usage yet.
Clearly see and hear all that is said
I think it's fine when I have used it - just not needed that much.
There are difficulties with links working, sometimes the sound doesn't work and it's challenging to start a meeting so we don't take the risk of figuring out whether we will have issues  and opt for telephone or in person meetings.
In the rooms that have it, make sure it working and easy to use.

Training and 1 pager user guides for WebEx, etc.
Quicker dial-in; VOIP via WebEx instead of separate phone call
more rooms with audio visual equipment
Better voice quality.

The equipment we have in conference rooms is unreliable. It is difficult to follow conversations when white boards are being used or the majority of the people are in the room (especially when there is a large audience).
Nike Digital already uses Slack which is getting better all the time
I am happy with the current tools.
Ease the log on process by having the audio be synchronized with the Web tool, currently we have to log on via laptop and dial in via phone.
Provide training on the use of the tools.
have more rooms and accessibility to HDVC
Have more tutorials on function and how to use.
The issue I with our factory partners as they do not have the newer technology nor do we always know it is available to us.
Provide examples of how these meetings can be useful to teams that work closely with team members they normally attend meetings with.
Provide easy to find, brief training on virtual meeting tools.
We need to standardize globally. Too many tools in use, and not all teammates have access to all tools.
depends on the team

More conference rooms equipped with technology in my building.
a way to manage comments from various callers so that people aren't trying to talk over one another.
more user-friendly than webex. Better interface. More simple.
Communicate what this is better
Easier to set-up multi group meetings with video-feed of each party
More WFH type of environment
no real complaints on webex technology. The big TV's we use for VC's / virtual meetings ALWAYS have a tech issue. Seems to always take a long time to get the right mode, and most often requires multiple connection attempts to host computer.
By teaching people how to have an effective meeting (behavior)

Some employees don't have webex rooms.  I am not sure why because some ETW said they requested access and were denied.  All employees should be able to host meetings.


Webex needs to be improved.
video conference equipment in more rooms
tutorial classes, signs/laminated quick guides or instructions  in conference rooms how to access projectors to view presentations


Blue Jeans better than WebEx - roll it out
Make it easier to share decks beforehand.
better phone technology for groups in conference rooms and have them in all conf rooms, more video conferencing availability, tools to help foster more collaborative meetings
Make sure the projection capabilities in all conference rooms are simple to use and operational at all times.  We have spent extra time waiting for meetings to start while the leader struggles with the conf room tools.
I've only used the tool once, it was easy to use.
make preloaded addresses available
Make it easy to get started for new users by making available easy to find information

We would benefit from improved audio on the video conferences-- we sometimes have trouble hearing those on the other end
A lot of times the TVs or the connections don't work or flicker in and out and/or change colors making the information you're projecting illegible.  It would be best if it were possible to link to conference room screens wirelessly through Airport etc.  Also, group conference calls are difficult when you're the one dialing in remotely to a meeting.  It's often difficult to hear what's going, especially when more than one person is speaking.
Need more larger meeting spaces

A technology *and* culture change will be required, including prompt start times to meetings.
No suggestions yet, but I am reluctant to sue video conferencing
Nothing comes to mind.
