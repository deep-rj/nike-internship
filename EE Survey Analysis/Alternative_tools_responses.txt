Ideally, more mobility (i.e., tablet devices with accompanying pens) so that all documents could be electronic and all work shared.


More community spaces and meeting rooms and a more agile laptop computer system.




Hard to work on a laptop monitor, would be great to have stations with monitors in various campus locations, that you could plug into. More touchdown rooms on campus. JM is awful for finding space to work when waiting to attend a meeting.






My work is of a type that benefits greatly from multiple monitors.  Although I love working away from my desk, there are times that productivity is reduce by using a small laptop screen.  
Better connection with WebEx when working remotely





Bluetooth headsets 







A functioning monitor around and electronic plugs within reach, especially near tables. Also, would love to have a computer that doesn't crash so much and has a longer battery life
Monitors available when away from desk



Bigger laptops.  I need large screens to effectively perform the work I do.
















"1. better virtual collaboration tools
2. some tech way that allows one to perform effectively in an agile work environment amongst a physically dispersed team
3.ensure that tools adopted are shared between Nike Tech/wholesale teams and Nike Digital Engineering/DTC.  Our teams are very intertwined and not using the same tools (and same environment for the tools, see Slack & Jira), makes collaborative work extremely challenging"
Better video conference and screen sharing technology. Easy access to monitors around campus. An easier ability to reserve open conference rooms on the fly (e.g. touchscreens in front of each conference room showing availability and reservability).




better video/phone conferencing, better speakers/audio in conference rooms
It would be helpful to have a secure site to link into from home without having to use your work laptop or phone
more reliable and widely used video conference, and conference rooms with reliable conference phones that are clear for participants to hear

Monitors are constantly broken so that I can not use a space to meet. (booths, flex spaces, and conference rooms)
Dual screens and docking station make it much easier to do my job which I can't find unless at my desk.





If I'm not on campus or at home, finding internet that is fast enough to work with the VPN is difficult.




More reliable laptop, better and standardized dashboard and reporting tools, larger IT support for tools and technology


Often connection to networks at WHQ crashes or has to reconnect very frequently when working away from campus. Personally switched connection to EHQ network when I'm away from campus as it doesn't need to re-connect to WHQ servers every 10 minutes. 

AnyConnect, Cisco







A reliable, approved video conferencing system that is easy to use would allow my team to work effectively 
it would be nice to connect wirelessly anywhere I go and not need to sign in to wifi. often times my laptop will not connect to the servers when I'm not at my desk
Need  a phone or laptop





Reliable WIFI or ability use mobile for tethering. Ability to work from Phone or tablet and log into a virtual work environment so that I have the same experience as my laptop.
i have the technology I need....  i don't feel all the groups i collaborate with are fully leveraging the same technology.  creates a collaboration gap.







Separate Monitor.  Ergonomic working area.  Port replicator that actually works with my software without crashing.

laptop screens too small to have all the windows i need visible. Toggling just isn't the same as having them all up at once. Also, having issues connecting to wifi or network drives when not at my desk can be a huge issue.



my job require heavy data analysis and wifi tends to be slow.  At my desk speeds up with a direct internet connection and dual monitors
VPN connection is unreliable, inconsistent

desk phones, big monitors







Open docking stations w/ monitors. Flipping between applications/spreadsheets is too difficult on just one screen, so being on laptop only slows me down considerably.
One thing is better battery life on my laptop. I have a Lenovo thinkpad 450 and I get only a few hours without being plugged in. Some meeting spaces I do not have outlets available. AnyConnect is also a bit annoying as well, when working from home it seems it constantly is showing "new location" found or disconnecting.




Mobile phone, tablet computer.

Better infrastructure to support collaboration / video.


















"- Our shared drives experience a lot of downtime making them unreliable, especially when using VPN
- Nike has not made single sign-on a priority making everyone less efficient
- HR systems and reporting tools are outdated, inefficient, and often inaccurate, requiring constant manual processes and workarounds
- Some tools work only on specific web browsers, requiring users to just know or learn the hard way
- Much of the information posted on Zero is outdated and/or inaccurate
- Overall, the lack of technology investment over the years has made it really difficult to do our jobs effectively and efficiently"


Updated/working computers



Better wifi, more monitors/screens available in flex work spaces.

Instant Portal like Sqwiggle 
Soft phones are a must!
Monitor/Dock/Charger/Keyboard/Mouse/Desk/Fixed Phone and number/Ethernet blue cable instead of Wifi

The only issue that I deem prevalent to not being able to work is in certain situations such as weather. When the snow storms were occurring and everyone was using the network at the same time (VPN), at times the systems would lag or the connection would get lost hindering us to be able to complete our daily tasks. I am unsure of how many servers are available when these situations occur, but this would be the one way that could assist in situations such as these.




VPN connectivity is awful, makes it hard to work from home

Better screen/stylus or touchpad would be helpful; I do design work that is difficult on a small laptop screen with the existing mouse
Speed connections while not Nike's fault is a huge reason why it is difficult to work remotely. Sometimes there are issues with connecting to the VPN.
More reliable wireless.

Better virtual meeting tools.








I need two monitors - hard to carry with you and set up.  Also, I like my own space, as I can't carry everything i need with me.











Calls routed to cell phone or VM, 



Soft phone is terrible

Laptop screens are too small for multiple Excel spreadsheets or multiple screen tasks (i.e. Chrome, Excel, SAP).

















Just simply a laptop, but I would just need to talk to my manager about this. 
Multiple monitors, white board, space to work with team and collaborate 
systems have trouble connecting to network when working remote. our systems are very tricky and hard to use unless on the network
Laptop in addition to my desktop









A reliable network connection that runs at a consistent speed.



My laptop weighs about 40 pounds and is very difficult to travel with. 
















Easier to use tools, tools that allow for better screen sharing and collaborative brainstorming activities 













same issue I raised earlier - improve the phones/microphones in campus conference rooms. other than that we have great tools - webex is great

I have a hard time connecting via the VPN from home. This is the most challenging part of working from home. 
iPad and pencil for note taking, ideating, and fluid thinking, monitor for detailed design work.








I think having a headset and VOIP for all employees would be beneficial. If not a dedicated desk headset, at least a portable USB headset. 




Monitors. 

more reliable network, better remote video tech (cameras, etc) - but the real problem is organizational, not technical!
Faster server speed. When opening large Excel files remotely, it takes forever to work.

For mobility purposes, lightweight laptops with longer batter lives (essentially Apple products) are currently not accessible for engineers. VPN connections are also often not reliable, especially when working abroad, since internet access is also spotty. However, tools like Box help tremendously in my ability to work away from my desk.




Additional monitors and/or deskspace. It's very challenging in Technology to work in freestyle without access to an additional monitor and ergonomic space. 

I need physical storage for a large number of items. If there was a way for this to be managed effectively, then I could work wherever I need.






Get rid of my desk phone and give me a iPad.  My computer is way too cumbersome.  
Headset options, quick connect to displays, less clunky laptop
Smoother running ticketing applications, functioning on company-wide wifi.







teleconference tool



More power outlets available in cafeterias.  A second screen is very helpful.







Working on my laptop is not ideal, it would be helpful to have monitors available to connect to.   


Better headset

"Computer/ access to Nike internet/ phone
"
laptop with Nike intranet


Phone, printer, office supplies
Often can't connect to wifi

Sometimes it's difficult to find wifi, it would be helpful if the AT&T service plan automatically enabled tethering so your phone could be a wifi hotspot.  The VPN connection is also challenging at times. 
Lync or a similar integrated phone system to streamline our collaboration technologies.







more upgrades to our technology














I recently moved to a freestyle location with no phone.  I have monitors available for my use but they are of lower quality than my Mac monitor I had to give up when I moved.

The VPN connection breaks too often for me to feel like I can work effectively anywhere.  That break will stop reports I am running which slows me down.






better conference rooms. Our team is spread globally and it's important to connect visually as well as audibly.




Printer






headphones w/ mic or better microphone in laptop AND one click app for video meetings

Extra monitors to plug into and more focus rooms with monitors












Remove land line phone completely.  Have more monitors set up for use in air lounges and more air lounges to set up and do some heads down work when away from your desk.


more / better monitors in the free style workspaces?
BETTER VPN, LOSE DRIVERS INTERMITTENLY WHEN NOT CONNECTED TO NIKE

I need multiple monitors and a dedicated keyboard to plan effectively


"VPN doesn't always work. My wifi has defaulted to trying to connect to Air Guest when I'm off my work station which is an inconvenience.
"



Monitor/Keyboard and good connection to the server
A laptop from this century coupled with product development software that's agile enough to move with me (i can't currently close my laptop and move without causing a crash and restarting the software takes (often, not even kidding) hours).


ipads, additional mobile devices, at least 1 more computer in the main office.
"1) Need consistent and reliable WiFi.  
2) although question is related to technology, the best technology in the world will be of little to no use unless it is human compatible. 
    a) One important aspect of not loosing sight of the human part of this equation is  ERGONOMICS, which  is very important.  When depending on a laptop and mouse, you still need a comfortable place to work.  So, unless we are working from home where we can control our environment, these are the challenges:
    --> monitor on laptop is typically too small for extended use
     --> keyboard on laptop is very bad for carpal tunnel syndrome
    --> Many freestyle sitting locations have TERRIBLE seating with NO lumbar support at all and not adjustable in any way which leads to back and neck problems.  For those of us whom already are dealing with these challenges, it just compounds these health issues.   Even when chair is not too uncomfortable and is somewhat adjustable...if we are changing locations throughout the day, we could be spending a good part of that day readjusting each new chair we sit in.
    -->  in order to make use of an ergonomic keyboard, we need docking station and as far as I am aware, Free Style seating does not offer that

  b) Another part of the human component is that we cannot shut down all our senses when trying to concentrate.  So, working in big open areas with lots of sights, sounds, and people moving to and from are a big distraction.  We are not all the same and some people are affected by distractions more than others.  So again, unless we are working from home where we can better control our work environment, I believe that the concept of 'we can work anywhere for any period of time as long as we have the technology' can be a big detriment to productivity.

c) Privacy / Security:  As an FTE, I log into the Me portal and check my check stubs and other personal info, read confidential email, etc.  A total open environment does not allow for the privacy needed for this unless we have monitors with good quality privacy screens

So.......in short, I ask that we are provided the technology that we need to be flexible about where we work.... but also provide us more control over the environment in which we use that technology in order to get our work done.  At our current desks, we can set up our workstation to meet our needs.  If we have the technology to truly work anywhere and still can collaborate/meet effectively then perhaps it is time to adjust Nike's Telecommuting policy to where (depending on the type of work you do) that you regularly work from home or work up to 4 days a week remotely.
"






Often server connection times and reliability are an issue, especially whilst abroad.

Sometimes it is difficult connecting to our AirFlight wifi. I don't know how this can improve, I just know it is important with a freestyle work space.

At times VPN doesn't seem to work if I am remote, or certain websites don't work at all. Aside from a standard audio conference line I don't know what video options Nike has. There is also a lack of good meeting spaces to use audio and video options on campus.










Ergonomic workspace for my frame.   Multiple large monitors.  Full sized input devices.  QUIET.
1 unified comms platform, not Jabber, slack, bluejeans, webex, etc.


















my work email is only accessible on the computer in the store, major part of my job. 

A new computer. An easily transported keyboard and a monitor solution.


Desktop monitors make working so much easier vs. off small laptop screen. And it's not just about techology or tools, it's the comfort of being in a space that when you leave it won't be taken when you come back or being able to leave your stuff if you go to the bathroom etc.



i can only work in places that have a secure internet connection and that i am able to log onto a wifi network
"1. Lack of charging points across the board
2. Wireless headsets
3. Lack of portable TV screens to display Kanban backlogs
4. Slow wireless connection at times"


I use a MacBook Pro with dual-thunderbolt display and like the size and resolution; i am a data scientist and graph a lot. We will be moving to a freestyle environment with Dell monitors that may take some getting used to.





Provide more access to power.  Provide a consistent experience in conference rooms (e.g. why don't all rooms have Enzo wireless presentation, why don't all rooms have dongles attached to the video cords).  Upgrade the wireless.
"It isn't so much that I don't have the tools - but I have hacked together the tools - with a tremendous amount of resistance from my teams and other partners - because of their general fear of tech and the reality that they don't trust leadership to leverage it - so why should they?  For example - look at most executive dashboards - they are key notes with a list of text and some colored dots that get compiled in advance of the mtg. Rather than a transparent, ongoing tech solution. Asana has been great - but again - having to self train on the tools and try and help with adoption - without a robust internal venue / training - its really difficult. 

The tools I have found to be the most helpful with the biggest upside:
Smartsheet
AirTable
Asana

"



There are constant technology issues with updates causing programs to crash, monitors (new) no longer working, internet connection slows, etc. 
My existing laptop struggles to retain a charge and sometimes has issues with connectivity within NIKE buildings


computer requires certain docking station, need adaptor just to plug in to share my screen in meetings, etc.

We are not given anything to work outside of the office



I answered no because the department I work in.  Since I work in HR Direct and my team supports employees calling in for assistance, we do not currently have the technology to answer employee calls outside our ACD phones.  













unreliable wifi and possibly computer capabilities to connect virtually

Longer laptop portable charger life. 
Ability to access tools external to Nike network. Ability to virtually collaborate





I often need two monitors and working straight off the laptop slows down the work flow




It's sometimes more efficient for me to stay in a building rather than drive back to my desk, but for some of my work I prefer additional screen real estate.  Unless it's a freestyle building few hotel spaces include monitors 







Constantly have server connectivity issues; slower responses in opening certain files remotely 

Faster systems and more efficient tracking tools 
Apple product that does not require to be shutdown for constant movement.  Also I struggle with connection moving my laptop.   


ability to easily connect to NIKE's intranet, not have to access 5 different systems to gathering the information I need to build a business case or make a decision.  Let's work smarter not harder; spend 80% of our time understanding business on a deeper more reliable level rather than 80% trying to pull information together and pushing out a "number" with very little thought to upstream/downstream impact of that reactive recommendation.  A bit more planning on our part for how to work will save a ton of time reacting and reworking.



Video conferencing abilities in our building








Laptop

Work anywhere is that from home? Then better technology
Stable WiFi and a large screen monitor






Headsets






i'm on a new mac so in the new dongles are not in conf rooms yet.  Have one power cord so have to unplug, pack, replug all the time.  not very efficient.  sometimes the technology in our conf rooms are broken or only partially working.

"First of all, can we have a lighter laptop? I got a new one last year with smaller screen but the battery got big. It didn't make sense at all. As an engineer, I need to use Adobe illustrator, Dimensions (footwear pattern software) to zoom in to the detail of drawing, or if I was dealing with data, I have bunch of data in excel I need to X-refernce. Small screen is just not great at all. But sometimes, we need to collect data by the machine or working station to collect data, or travel to Asia, and have to work from laptop.
As I mentioned earlier, I like schare screen function when I have ad-hoc meeting wtih my Engineer counterpart who sits in different building. I think it will be great if I can incorporate camera in Jabber. I think we had that function in similar software before we mvoed on to Jabber/webex connect. That way, I can show the parts to my counterpart, or I guess I can use facetime? 
We are using Watcdox for security reasons, and was told that we will move onto something better. It is a cumbersome system and I'd love to have the transition soon. User friendliness is a key for any technology."


I am best working when i have my dual screens, key board, and mouse. Working from just a laptop is cumbersome when needing more screen space 
iPad for reading and writing docs while I am on the go--in a train commuting for example
"VPN is painfully slow
"


When my MAC needs a certificate update, I'm required to go back to campus in order to get it working again. 



Second power cable for the laptop. It's quite a mess to always plug and unplug it from a docking station. Which also makes it quite obsolete.
WIFI takes forever to kick in and is unreliable.  




More desk spaces with desktop screens








I need a light weight laptop.. mine is very heavy and I have to carry it everywhere with me. Also noise cancelling headphones would be great. 
Video conferencing. Even if I can video in from a remote location my colleagues back at WHQ don't typically have video conference equipment in their meeting rooms. Also many of the shared focus rooms in west campus don't even have conference phones in them and many of them don't have tables or chairs, making them useless for meetings or collaborative working.
my vpn connection fails regularly 
Wireless stabilty, more VC equipment, better data plans to allow you to take calls everywere regarding the connectivity, etc



company Cell Phone, company ipad, more reliable laptop. The older laptops start having issues while mobile a lot more than people that rarely move around a lot. Those that attend a bunch of meetings or are working on global projects need newer technology, better connectivity, and reliable sources of internet anywhere.

The VPN has an unacceptable level of performance - it consistently connects and disconnects over and over again, which completely disrupts the work flow.   
"I would have to carry power chord (mac and pc) if I did not have an assigned desk.
Management of technology available in existing places are not kept updated all the time(broken HDMI cables) no HDMI to display port cables etc. "
More charging station equipment for laptops available in conference rooms and other common spaces.







I need a large monitor or two. I use two large monitors and my laptop screen at my desk (3 screens)

i often have issues with anyconnect when working at home and other places outside of campus

I understand that Nike is moving toward a work-anywhere, unreserved work location workspaces -  but I need a designated work location with two monitors every day to complete my Tasks. Working in multiple systems at any given moment is the limiting factor to being able to work anywhere.
"Issues at times logging in remotely. This has improved in recent months. Some tools have challenges logging in remotely. 

"




conference calls are very challenging as it is a mixed bag of sound and video(screen sharing) quality. Also, when a whiteboard session needs to take place, folks are used to just using the whiteboard meaning folks that are not present physically is left out
Integrated phone system. My laptop usually works great from wherever and I have a Nike mobile phone, but would be great if phone and laptop were integrated, maybe no need for Nike phone?


easy to use video conferencing on my laptop. mobile tethering for my laptop

Better laptop, more comprehensive virtual workspace where my common tools and drive space are accessed easily and quickly.











we have tools that are locked down to Nike IPs, however new IPs continually are added, leading to disruptions until we are able to add the new IP


VPN is unreliable. Sometimes an the nike internal sites and tools work fine, but most of the time they don't causing loss of productivity and time spent in debugging.
larger monitors. 



Our telephony and video conferencing technology as well as meeting etiquette are needing to be better.




Video conference technology, more standardized use of file sharing/collaboration tools. too many options exist so many people use many different ones, limiting simple collaboration.
I can only do my job in one spot

I have an old laptop that dies very quickly. I need to be by an outlet at all times.

It would be awesome to be able to have on-demand video conferencing ability instead of needing to find a video-enabled conf. room that is usually booked weeks in advance. Conf. rooms and equipped space are non-existent for time-sensitive mtgs. to resolve late-breaking issues or just collaborate efficiently across multiple time zones in EMK/APLA.


My computer doesn't like to stay connected to the VPN when off campus. This takes away a lot of my ability to do the systems work I need to do when not at WHQ. Even when travelling through Asia, I need that ability to connect when at the factories.

iPad with full use of Nike apps

Better computer

















I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN IPAD WITH A STYLUS TO TOTALLY TAKE AWAY THE USE OF PAPER. MAC ONE NOTE IS 50% THERE BUT NOT ABLE TO DRAW OR WRITE WHEN NEEDED




More reliable wifi
More tools to ad screen real estate away from my desk (proper cords, adapters, etc.)

wifi coverage when moving around campus becomes spotty 



ipad, more powerful laptop






Video conferencing software that works on my computer.
Reliable internet connection; portable printer




Mobile hotspot when not close to wifi



Accses nike sites from other connections
better and easier to use systems


Mobile POS
VPN connectivity from home is molasses slow.  Takes about 10 times as long as at the office for files to open










Smaller more mobile devices would help dramatically.








Get rid of desk phones. Give everyone a cell phone. Connect the AD to our phones so we can see internal numbers as people not the main switchboard.  



Perhaps the job is not suited for working anywhere, due to the need to provide hands-on facilitation?








Laptop with better battery life, a company cell phone, company headphones with microphone
Access and device larger than an IPhone to complete training and emails connected to Zero and my Shared Drive 




same as what i mentioned previously. In addition, our collaboration tools are not great. We had Google docs/sheets which were great, but then a decision was made to migrate to Box, which is fine as a storage tool, but fails abysmally as a collaboration tool. I'm not sure anyone did a thorough tool analysis with the user base.

laptop to use in front of store










"a lot of web access is limited to campus proximity. In addition we don't use it too much for our jobs
"

I do not currently have the ability to connect to the network with hot-spot connectivity



monitors that work,   softphone that works consistently (half my team where not able to get it to work and gave up)


"As a coach I use my own phone and iPad a lot to response to emails, planning etc to complete my work load at work and at home.  This sometimes means I go over my data which should be for personal use. 
"

Always away from desk




the lap tops are out of date and way too heavy to carry around all the time. Would love just an ipad or something that can connect to our systems.




Better internet 








I work in a Freestyle space. I wish that Technology supported us with noise-cancelling headphones - with greater density of people and limited focus rooms, it's hard to find quiet. 



Smaller laptop that has touchscreen capabilities




I need power in all the possible places that I may sit (or stand) to work.  currently some of the work area/stations in Merlin do not have power so although I'd like to utilize those areas, I need to choose from limited locations so that I can stay plugged in for my laptop to work effectively.



I need better internet/server access when I am not at my desk. Wifi and remote access make it difficult to efficiently work on the Nike servers.

need faster and more reliable wifi...



My laptop (HP EliteBook) has continuing problems with the wireless adaptor, so I can only work where there is an Ethernet connection.




Large Monitor and better ergonomic options - struggle with elbow tendinitis and neck pain with prolonged laptop use


A tool can provide high-quality radio/video connections for meetings.






Blue Jeans






Inconsistent network access can limit the usage of tools requiring authentication through Nike servers.

A station with a screen where I can connect my device.
I need more monitors at my remote location.  



RELIABLE vpn.

A different laptop.
servers are MUCH slower working via wifi/offsite. My team needs multiple monitors setup to work efficiently; one laptop screen is not enough

Would like to print at home via my home printer.  
Monitor, phone, keyboard and most importantly the chair at my desk that is for my back.  Had back surgery a few years ago and changing chairs can aggravate and cause pain.
Better or Efficient Computer Devices 
VPN is consistently slow and unreliable

My computer is not the most efficient and up to date 
Better knowledge of different apps and perhaps an ipad
Mobile hotspot




Cleaner connection to internet, easier to share files and get on line.  Webex is improving.

VPN is really slow!

Need celluar hot spot
I don't actually know, but rely on the tech experts to tell me what is available



I could do my job from everywhere, but effective is a loose term. Connections to Nike drives are so painfully slow when off the network that you can almost get nothing done. Much of my productive work also requires multiple high resolution screens, and my laptop doesn't come close to cutting it. Maybe a larger laptop screen with a higher resolution would help, but there would still be network access issues. 


Better laptops that have longer battery life, network speed to support the remote location. 

More touch down stations or focus rooms to have a calls. 


for meetings and note-taking, would like an iPad or other Notebook type device to capture notes using One Note or Evernote;  currently take notes in a Moleskine journal but then frequently need to transpose to digital and also don't have the option to call back up if necessary

A Laptop or ipad, something wireless 

Improved sound quality


I would benefit from an iPad with the tools/apps which would allow me to take notes in meetings, convert to word/powerpoint/email and access all my shared drives etc.


I constantly have connection issues having to do with too many people accessing the server via VPN

Mobile hot spots
Hard to connect to citrix when working remotely...








My headset is a bit finicky, and requires me to change my audio playback and other say they can barely hear me, which is disappointing as it works fine with my phone.  Also, if you want me to use my personal cell phone, you need to provide me some benefit of doing so - pay for data, messages, and calls.  Currently, that is not an option on my team.
Wifi hotspot
Light weight laptops should be the standard



everything needs to be available for mobile! like BNX, etc.
Employees should have iPads to work remotely in meetings. Laptops are heavy and clunky, not conducive for working remotely or traveling between buildings for meetings. Laptops are slow and consistently crash; limited battery life. 

Connectivity 
For my job, I need multiple screens so really the technology I would need to be effective would be a laptop with extendable screens...



I don't have access to the Nike server anywhere outside of my building.


when I work virtually, I don't have access to our shared servers - even when connected to wifi.  I need to access files and typically save to my desktop - but that's not always realistic when sharing information.

Easier communication with coworkers outside of the office. Video meetings integrated with Outlook, phone conferencing options
When I try to work on the weekends from a Starbucks or other location I am blocked and I don't know who to ask to help. 



Rumor is we are moving to a Flex work space environment which will not work well for the work I do.  I spend a lot of time reviewing contracts and spreadsheets and my current work space has multiple monitors that allow me to do this effectively.  With a Flex work space I will have to 'hunt' for space to work which will decrease my efficiency dramatically.
Extra monitor, quiet space

I have the appropriate tools, however, as stated previously, the connection issues cause my laptop and phone to have spotty service in the office and away.  Sometimes I can click on an email to read and it takes a couple of minutes for the email to come up.  This can slow down production within Outlook.
Better, more portable devices. iPad and iPhones.



my laptop is big/bulky/heavy
Just a better connection to be able to make sure it works to login to my computer when not at work. Sometimes I can't get my email to connect to the Nike server. 



VPN has been extremely unreliable for working from home after hours










I feel as though certain jobs require more than just a laptop, so it would be nice to have spare monitors available to pop on and use in designated spots on campus

The key to successful scrum teams is to have co-location for quick conversations and quickly resolve issues. Free style seating means that I have to track down people or work via IM/phone. Not conducive to building high functioning teams that have a lot of interdependent work... Works fine if team members have separate deliverables.  

"A way to carry all my stuff around back packs are hard to carry everything and keep things straight.  Sometimes needing a big screen is helpful but can't carry that around.
"
I very solid VPN connection -- I had my VPN crash and stop working a couple weeks ago and it required an IT person to come in person to fix it.





Multiple monitors and full size keyboard due to large spreadsheets and complex task requirements




"lighter laptop, better battery, digital note taking ability
"
Large screen to process complex and large data sets.  Using a small screen would be inefficient and time consuming.  I need a desk because with lab testing materials are dropped off on my desk and need to be at my desk while writing test reports.  Fighting for space at a table would be a waste of time and very distracting.
VPN not always working.
End user Computing policy providing standard laptops which would then assist with standard AV.  With multiple types of laptops it is challenging for each user.  Typically each user has to carry multiple adapters with them in hopes that one of them will work in a conference room.  It takes too long to connect which tends to delay meetings.




"quicker laptop
"


Tools to be able to manage same reports or convections needed in my work desktop




A better network, better software, and more instructions to go along with any new technology. 



Video conferencing from PC.

My job is contract review and negotiation, so two monitors are the ideal set up (which I have at my desk).  Access to a single large monitor would help me effectively work anywhere (because I could use the laptop's monitor as a second screen).  Working off of the laptop's monitor alone is really not an option for effective and efficient contract review.






MONITOR AND KEYBOARD




I use multiple monitors as a data analyst.  When working remotely, or not at my desk, I miss having multiple screens.  Also, I feel that not having a real keyboard and mouse slow me down.





a VPN that works 

In freestyle, improved internet connection, monitors, keyboards and mice functionality.  Laptop updates more frequently. 

Fast connection to the many programs I need to work in and ability to connect to servers.


remote connection to Shared Folder is weak





At Nike, connectivity is not always reliable - to connect to Zero, servers/share drives, other various "systems" we (such as SAP, Coupa, TimeTrack, Tradeshift, Me Portal).   WEBx could be simpler and more user friendly and expanded to make data share and camera share more seamless.  Purchasing software and hardware tools is clunky. The system is not easy, consistent. Delivery is not done in a timely manner. No response from asset management is quite frustrating.

We need more reliable Wifi - especially in our territory offices. We also need more ability to do face-to-face/collaborative work with people that are located outside of the US.
With Finance, we need large and multiple monitors, so mobile working is more difficult. We can get done with basic tasks remotely, but analytical crucial work requires multiple and bigger screens for Excel spreadsheets, etc.

"Modern laptop
"

better wifi and cell phone service in some buildings.  mine for instance is terrible for phone service, and if too many people are on the wifi during a meeting (like in TWC) you can't get on.
The VPN network slows down many of the processes that I need to perform.   I also work with large files that take a long time to load when using VPN.







possibly better ways to document what the children are doing, an option to input information while out on walks, around campus or on the play ground. Or if there are different types of technology tools to use
With product presentation- sometimes there are items not listed in the directive that we have to check on the BOH PC's for clarification. If we have an Ipad on the floor it would make it that much easier to show/train athletes in color instead of printing B&W copies. 
I am a DTC leader, an Ipad with all report access would be a game changer. 






Video conferencing where everyone in the meeting is on your screen, super simple screen sharing and passing screens around, ability to whiteboard in the virtual meeting (maybe the most important for me).  Softphones built into the laptop that connect automatically to a conference call.

VPN from home can be spotty.  The VPN connection will drop and relog every few minutes sometimes.  For conference calls away from my desk that are also on webex I have to use my own personal iPad for the webex portion of the meeting.  All of this is dependent upon having wifi.  Without wifi i am stuck trying to be on the call and viewing a slide presentation on my phone.


"Zoom.us

current laptop is not powerful enough to use for some remote uses as well as wifi is flakey

Make it easier to plug in when I'm in another building-and have a space that I can go that isn't disrupting someone

More ability to charge my laptop - I run out of power and dont always have my charger. Or it is hard to find a place to plug in from some of the freestyle spaces (Cafe's & lounges)








It would be nice to have conference phones available in more places or noise cancelling headphone/microphones to hook up to our laptops/phones.
more reliable VPN









some computer updates require being plugged into the blue cable, which i don't always have access to when away from desk





Dual screen desk access
I wish I had better wireless access. I frequently lose wireless and taking a large computer around with me all day isn't always the best way to take notes, share information or email. 
Nike technology in general is not very good compare to my previous companies. I think better file sharing, collaboration tool, and video conferencing tool will be helpful.  
Being able to travel with a 15 inch mac is great. But my tasks need more screen space. So I usually remain at my desk where I have external monitors.


system is slow, hard to read laptop screen when not plugged to monitors.  mouse difficult on laptop, (have to carry a desk with me when mobile (a bunch of stuff, mouse, connector (for projection), etc)
my laptop is in horrible condition and I get dropped off VPN a lot













"bigger faster laptop, a mouse
"
I wish I had Cognos Framework Manager as an application but do to cost I can't get it.  I wish I had an Ipad but due to cost cannot get it.
"Leadership willing to allow us to work remotely.
"

Have dual-screen in free-style & at home, but many other non-freestyle buildings on the NW campus don't seem to have many visitor workspaces setup, and none that I know with dual-monitors.






Voicemails from your desk phone to your computer. When I worked in EMEA we used to get our desk voicemail to your email, this was super handy and you would never miss anything. I think in WHQ it is more the mindset that working from home means "not working". I think more time should be spend on changing that mindset than just improving our collaboration (technical ) tools. I used to work from home 1 day / week in Europe but that seems to cause more resistance here......




My work requires a constant network and all of the various changes have left certain internal sites inaccessible from the VPN.





it would be nice to be able to do more things on my phone, or have a lighter lap top to travel with. 
I need people to be present and make decisions together looking at physical samples and submits.  I don't think that can be done remotely.  A web based spec program will help.  



Faster VPN connection






Better wifi access. More powerful laptops with the best of the best memory+...and software tools that are user friendly for all platforms (Mac or PC)...drag and drop.

Consistent VPN connections and ability to run all systems on VPN and not have them be slowed down. Also need two monitors generally which I have at my desk and it's hard to get that set up other places.





More concierge reception style 
A monitor


Better collaboration tools for managing cross-functional projects and engaging in virtual meetings where group interaction and white-boarding is needed. 
My job requires having two monitors (plus my laptop) to most effectively do my work.  




Lighter weight technology.  Ability to achieve reliable network connections.

when I work from other buildings, I miss having a monitor available.





easier access to data via laptop (so I have all my files) when traveling (not just when I'm on wireless or connected via smartphone).







web cam for video calls

I need a big screen to create presentations and better wifi for connectivity.


iPad, work virtually during rush hours

















The computers we have use tiny screens that cut off too munch content.  For me to work anywhere at Nike or home efficiently, I either need a much larger screen notebook or always plug into a monitor even when I am in a meeting.  Ideally anywhere I want be productive, I would use two monitors or have a much bigger than baseline monitor.  That's how I roll.

issues logging on off campus through network. 

voice and video over laptop









Working remotely on large files that need to be downloaded or uploaded is very slow and sometimes fails completely.  Need better remote connection capabilities.
Many aspects of my job require significant screen real estate (multiple monitors) to be effective 





VPN has been very unreliable when working from home




It's challenging for me to do too much work remotely on my small laptop.  I need a monitor, mouse, etc. to be more effective.
I NEED A BIG MONITOR, NOT JUST A LAPTOP TO BE FAST.  I WORK IN DESIGN


Available docking stations or monitors
Access to large/multiple monitors in freestyle spaces





"COGNOS does not perform as smoothly offsite
"


easy lobby and intelidesk.

Firewalls make it hard to work from home and get on db systems and remain connected
Jabber is great for instant messaging, but it would be a huge improvement to be able to click on a name and have it call them directly, rather than looking them up in a directory and manually dialing. This is applicable for being away from you desk, or at it. 




I only have my laptop and phone. The laptop is old and outdated so I spend more time on my phone answering emails when i am away from my desk. 

















Monitors, keyboards, mice, phones.  The softphones really do not work and there was never any training on how to use it when we moved into Tanasbourne / Blazer.


Robust, stable wireless connectivity.   Outlook can be slow when disconnecting from Network to Wi-Fi.  Nice collaboration spaces with monitors placed for use to support work which requires a larger screen.

HDVC capability from anywhere.  Faster tool to update spec and connect to servers

"in my job we do a lot of graphics, so the laptop is not big enough screen to use this way and prefer to have a larger screen to view our information with.
"

A hotspot or access point for internet connection when we are no where near WIFI.




I would need wifi embedded within my device.
If I was expected to work from home, effective Home office 

A larger monitor at my house - I spend a lot of time in excel, and it is challenging solely on a work laptop




I am in multiple buildings and campus, so I work very mobile.  However it would be good to have some areas where monitors are available.  Laptops work, but not as effective as monitors.  Would be great if some areas around each campus had some freestyle working spaces that are quiet.
Dual monitor capabilities away from my desk.

Better teleconferencing ability


A docking station with a monitor



need to address how to work anywhere when working on an agile scrum team.  How do we bridge the gap for not being physically present?  How can we still have effective working meetings for collaboration with diverse teams (IT & biz) without requiring people to be present for whiteboarding, sticky storms, ability to hear all in the room, etc




Need to have a corporate provided app that allows you to connect to the share drives when connecting via VPN. with an iPad.  If this was available I would be able to do the majority of my job.


I'd need a large monitor to work efficiently away from my desk

Conference lines, group video chat, consistent video conferencing in campus meeting rooms
